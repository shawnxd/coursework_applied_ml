Leaving go down to the garden , a metre from here you 'll find a canary , stop running to hear a gap between species was never so near as she tells you , she yells , `` you are wrong . '' you 'll runn up the hill , an indignant opposer `` I should n't have heard that , it 's you who had chosen her '' away in the distnce the wind calmly blows her you realize that you are not strong . a message from home , but do you remember ? the solitude that you repelled last december a conformist haven where you were a member you know now , they know how you 're gone .
