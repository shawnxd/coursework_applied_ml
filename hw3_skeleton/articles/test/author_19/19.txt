misplaced superiority shut yourself up is what i 'm really trying to say as you stand smug and technologically advanced yet unaware of my meaningless name without regard for tasteless slurs realizing not only ethnicity 's a battle and i am a woman and surely and poorly will never be better than you . yes this powerful creator who i do not praise who i do not even believe as tangible hangs over me with every wrongdoing a veil preventing well deserved contentness and you say `` that is why '' `` that is why she will forever delve into darkness . '' and you are wrong as you do n't know what i have discovered and even if you did you would be wrong and i know what you have have done blasting down the best of us for fun and i know where you find comfort tucked inside the barrel as you aim and you are wrong . and i know what we all do and i know what we do n't and how the world destroyed itself resulting in today . i know this and we are all wrong .
