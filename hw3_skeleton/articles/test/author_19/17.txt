'' `` it 's not like i hide it or try to just fight it you do not a thing , you just sit there and light it and say , 'why is she sad , there 's nothing that 's wrong ' but it does n't matter , my future is gone '' `` shut up you rich girl , you have it all never a suffer from winter 'til fall '' `` then i will just die here , and you wo n't be sad '' `` you 're right , you deserve it , you 're nothing but bad ''
