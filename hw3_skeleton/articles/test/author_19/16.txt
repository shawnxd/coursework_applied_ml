i have ripped apart my insides so that they now mold together with the surface and there is nothing left between to make me whole . i take now this knife and stab it into my chest where it will forever stay . when i am dead and buried it will still be there constantly reminding me of better worse days . the days of time that lasted ages yet went in milliseconds ticking toward the doom so sure to follow . the days of useless drama , though trying pointlessly to avoid its circumstances . they days of yearning for acceptance of the masses thereby torturing my soul . the days of striving from the depth of my core for one thing my heart perpetually desires and failing .
