a revelation A challenge arisen to pinpoint my state , for musings to outwardly show ; A faltering picture of vacant surmisings is all I can summon , or know . I 'm dying to say that I 'm lying today , but so little of former times changed . The principal whining and effort filled rhymings just different in how they 're arranged . That is n't to say that I 'm wholy the same ; that I 'm still quite unsure from within . Now it 's as if I 've discovered the cause , but purposely bottle it in . My one optimism in finding a rose though plagued with some unhidden thorns , has bettered the weather , but sure , I am never ; with discontent normalcy 's born So I 'm still a tree in this forest of guilt , yet disovering I can get by . The daily routine of the pain I had built is stll present , just shifted aside .
