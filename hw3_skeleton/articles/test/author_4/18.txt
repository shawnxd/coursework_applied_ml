Yes , what exactly is wrong with the System ( of Quixtar TM , e.g . BWW TM ) ? It gives people opportunity to make money . If some one hasn ’ t been successful , s/he should change some thing . After all : Businesses work , people do n't Ok here is what ’ s wrong . Quixtar System , in my opinion , is not completely in accordance with FTC rules . `` System '' teaches it that way . Please read FTC site . urlLink http : //www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/pyrdalrt.htm And more : urlLink http : //www.amquix.info/TOD_FAQ.html In a nutshell , here are my concerns : Not so legal activity 1 : Does every IBO meet the 50 PV retail rule ? My upline told me to report 50 PV as retail . Did I `` retail '' 50 PV , NO ! I was told to lie . Not so legal activity 2 : In pyramids , a product , which has no value outside the pyramid , should not be sold to participants . What about the `` system '' ? How many retail customers will buy tapes ? Quixtar saves its ass by saying it is optional , but `` system '' tells so is success , and one must be on standing order to show their seriousness . And seminars , oh man ! Try to be in good books of your upline while not attending them . Not so legal activity 3 : If I am behind my quota , I should not be receiving call from some upline to complete my order . I ca n't retail in last hour ! I 'll end up stocking . Stocking = > Illegal ! ! I 've received such calls . And after a year of quitting , I still have those stocked products , along with the pile of tapes . I lost time and money in BWW TM / Quixtar TM . Am I alone ? Nope ! There are 40 million ppl who have joined and left Quixtar TM / Amway TM in last 40 years . There are 400,000 active IBOs in North America . How many of them are making money ? I am talking about the profit section of their Income Tax return , not the net income box . And here is the best : It is a urlLink negative some game . At any given time , This Quixtar / BWW pyramid as a whole is losing money . How the top dudes make money ? By product movement and system push to their downline . What is the average income of an active IBO ? According to Quixtar , $ 115 . And it is a net profit , including bonus coming from one ’ s own shopping . What is the average expense of the system ? STO + expensive self consumed products + Seminars + gas + baby sitting etc . Lets say $ 300 , a very conservative figure . How these guys pay for it ? Ironically , Jay Oh Bee . So what is “ System ” doing ? Sucking money into it . As a whole , at any give time , whole organization is losing money . As there are some expenses going outside the system , e.g . travel etc .
