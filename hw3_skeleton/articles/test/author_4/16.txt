A kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous . Ingrid Bergman I do n't know why I quoted this stupid quote : ) Not all quotes make sense . For a while , I was thinking about my involvement with Quixtar , and I was wondering `` Who I have a problem with ? '' Quixtar ? Or BWW ? My upline or my sponsor ? I would be objective here : Quixtar They are basically a portal on which people build their businesses . I actually do n't have any beef with them . I 'd try to be even more objective , so here it goes : Pros Excellent products : They are 20-50 % more expensive but it was upline + BWW push to do 300PV , not them . They even have average IBO income stated and have 50 PV retail rule . Good old Shoppers Drug Mart is also quite expensive , so I do n't have a problem here . Customer Service : I have not received better customer service anywhere else ! Their buy back guarantee is awesome , I ’ ve returned a lot of items : ) Cons They turn a blind eye to all the abuses done by BWW and other Motivational organizations . In their response to the NBC Dateline segment , they defended themselves , not BWW or other QMOs ( Quixtar motivational organizations ) while no one actually attacked them ! They refused to appear on Dateline show , while they were given a chance , and put a recorded response way before the dateline show was even aired . I do n't know why they are hiding ? They should enforce mlm rules more strictly . But as Ken McDonald said to Bo Short , `` What would happen to the business '' BWW urlLink ( Britt World wide ) Pros Learned public speaking , people skills Learned very good teachings from books Cons An QMO , responsible for doing some not-so-legal stuff i.e . moving a product that has no end customer , like tapes / books / seminars . Their representatives sucked me in , and 'motivated ' me to waste money in expensive products . I have a pile of tapes sitting on my home , full with hype and bashing everything other than the `` system '' . Average cost to be a core : $ 60 STO + $ 24 opens + $ 100 / month ( 6 trips to US , one trip cost AT LEAST $ 200 ) + 300 PV = > $ 650 extra ( 300 PV is actually $ 750 but I subtracted $ 100 I saved by avoiding Wal-Mart ) + $ 50 extra fuel + $ 21 Kate + $ 10 website = $ 915 / month And my upline said how one could loose money in this business ! Priceless ! ( $ 915 x 9 months ! ) Upline Well , I wo n't talk about my personal experiences with them . If some of my relatives read it , it would be hard for me to refrain them from getting physical against that dude . I 'll picture a general , business view of them . Pros Drove several time from US to Canada for me Worked on my prospects Spent time talking / yelling at me Cons Make me spent $ 900 ish a month , including push for seminars , tapes , leadership tapes and put order on 30th , which is still stocked . I ’ ve left more than a year now ! I was not told the number and cost of conferences , STO , traveling involved . I should 've known so I could make an informed decision . Brainwashed , or try to brainwash me that system is only thing good in the world , rest is pure evil . Put religion second , business first attitude . When I told I quit , kept talking to me on phone for 1.5 hours while I was at the office and he was at home Called me several time on my cell , resulting huge bill , despite my request not to Told me FTC approved this business . FTC never stamp on any business , it just has some guidelines . BWW violates some of them ! Sponsor Pros Never pushed me to sign me in , never begged me not to quit Always calm , cool and nice Helped me on daily basis Lend me lit packs , books and tapes Cons Lied to me , by giving impression that they are making profit . I really doubt they are making any profit to date , which at least covers their expense . There were $ 5K worth of tapes in their guest room last time I saw ! I was not told the number and cost of conferences , STO , traveling involved . I should 've known so I could make an informed decision . When I quit , they told me after a month that I was not doing business properly . Dude ! I was with you at least one hour daily for a year , why did n't you tell me then ? I did whatever you told me ! I have asked about the tools , I don ’ t know if I could return them . That will be the real test of character . I 've yet to see ! So it turns out , I 've a beef with QMO , i.e . BWW , not exactly with Quixtar . Well a little with Quixtar . BWW need to make training free and easy . People should n't have to spend so much time and money on 'training ' . Free Mp3s on net , no seminars will make it much feasible . My system expenses should not be more than $ 30 a month . Also retail should be taught to IBOs and should be necessary . Self consumption should be discouraged . In fact , 70 % of the products should be retailed , as FTC said !
