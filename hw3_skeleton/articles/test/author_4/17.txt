This is the name of a BWW tape , not negative ol me bashing all free enterprise : ) This tape says how ppl doing a JOB are pigs , and they do n't know that how stinky job is , as every one around them has a job . So , Pigs do n't know pigs stink . Let me carry this statement a little further . I wo n't call who is a pig and who is not , but I 'll very humbly try to let the 'pigs ' know they stink . Hey you started it ! I am using your tape title . After all , you know so many nuggets of wisdom that rhymes and poetic brainy quotes . So here it goes , p*** do n't know that : Bill Britt did n't retire , he was asked to urlLink resign . urlLink He and Peggy were separated on November 21 , 2003 . urlLink Why they were separated . Peggy claims him to have lost over $ 20 million in fraudulent investment schemes . urlLink IBO Hall of Shame , who stinks now eh ? A Diamond walked away form diamond ship ! urlLink http : //formerdiamond.com/ urlLink NBC story about Quixtar ( in the front page of above site ) urlLink rebuttal Quixtar 's response to the show . urlLink Quixtar business analysis page And some data from that page : amquix.info quote : 67.7 % of IBOs who registered in 2001 , did not renew in 2002 . The average IBO had just 0.23 members and clients registered Only 18.4 % of IBOs registered even one person . The average IBO had 38.5 PV/month . ( 100PV is shown in the plan ) 65.6 % of IBOs never once attained 100 personal PV in the previous 11 months . 21.5 % of IBOs had a ditto delivery profile Only 1.9 % of Members and Clients had ditto delivery profiles . The average PV point cost $ 2.70 . And on the same site : urlLink http : //amquix.info/amway_directly_speaking.html Rich DeVos said : Now , the tape business , if it is not used as a support for the Amway business , will oftentimes be an illegal business -- in fact , it could be called a pyramid -- because , d -- does not get sold to the consumer . Which means that all the tape business does is take money out of the organization , and because the final person ca n't retail it , it never brings money into the organization . Now , I 'm not arguing about the value of it -- we accept the fact that motivation is vital to this business . Good , honest motivation is important to the business . But , it must be motivation that builds the business -- not become a business in itself .
