There are two types of people , people who have money and people who have excuses . Quixtar / BWW tape talk When I was in the BWW TM / Quixtar TM business , Diamond lifestyle was my only goal . The only people who appeared successful to me were diamonds , and every body else was a broke looser . I encountered a lot of 'negative ' prospects , yet no one was able to give me a logical reason what 's wrong with BWW / Quixtar . Reason being they have not done any formal research on it . Even if they did make some point which I could n't answer , I always said , `` How much money do you make , smarty pants ! Your lifestyle sucks as compared to the diamonds . If you are so smart , why you are not so rich '' . Well , i did n't exactly say it but you get the idea . For me they were making excuses and avoiding work . They did n't have enough money to impress me , yet they had a lot of excuses . To all other people who are in Quixtar TM and think like I did , let me tell you a story about a person who did not make any excuses . He was no lazy nose-picker . He was a diamond , and he was rich . He became a diamond in 5 years . Not many people are able to do that . But then he discovered something . He found that a legal and ethical product business done by a somewhat restrictive MLM model can only generate upto a certain amount of money . Money enough to replace job but certainly not enough to own jets , yachts and palaces etc . Then he found out something else was going on . There are a lot of tools pushed to other people involved in Quixtar TM . In fact , one wo n't be called `` serious in the business '' if s/he is not on monthly tape and book program , which costs $ 60 - $ 80 a month . In fact there are more tapes recommended than that , leadership tapes or fast track tapes . There are seminars almost every month all over US and they are pushed very seriously . These seminars costs at least $ 80 USD . And cost of hotel & traveling makes them even more . And even paying all those expenses did n't deliver the promise of `` success '' to a very overwhelming majority . He saw that most people end up loosing some serious money on these `` tools '' . Wait , It gets better ! What is in these tapes ? What is `` taught '' in seminars ? Almost ALL hype and promoting the `` system '' . So what he did ? He RESIGNED from the Diamond ship . Something a person with integrity and morals should do . So what am I doing , Am I making up lies ? Is n't it what internet does ? spread lies about good organization ? Well , his name was Robert 'Bo ' Short . He was on Dateline NBC . Read it here : http : //msnbc.msn.com/id/4375477/ Also , you may visit his website , http : //www.formerdiamond.com .
