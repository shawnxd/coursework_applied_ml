Bkgd : In TFA , we are divided into working groups . My group lovingly refers to ourselves as the Tenacious Ten . The Tenacious Ten was forced to come up with a group cheer for Cornelius ( our school 's ) end of the week meeting . ( The Tenacious Ten huddle together in the middle of the cafeteria . Ryan , the lone male , leans into the huddle and yells , `` 123 Break ! '' The Ten quickly fan out into a straight line . ) READY , OK ? ! ( Our hands clasp in front , cheerleader-style . We begin to clap rhythmically . ) I say JOURNAL/You say OUT JOURNAL ( point to selves ) OUT ( point to audience ) JOURNAL/OUT I say NORM/You say OUT NORM/OUT NORM/OUT I say SHARE ; you say OUT NORM/OUT NORM/OUT Journal it out ! Norm it out ! Share it out ! CORNELIUS ! ( Saturday Night Live style Jazz hands ) You may have to be in TFA to understand how truly brilliant this cheer is .
