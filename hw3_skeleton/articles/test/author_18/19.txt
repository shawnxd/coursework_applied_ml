Imagine , if you will , 700 sleep-deprived recent college graduates living together in a concrete box . Imagine that approximately 3/4 of the 700 sleep-deprived college grads are women .

It is indeed the end of the month ; we live in a concrete box ( aka Moody Towers ) , and none of us sleep . I 'll let you do the math .
