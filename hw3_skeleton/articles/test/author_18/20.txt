Teachers have to put lesson plans in these big binders and set them in a noticeable area of their classrooms so that observers and higher-ups can flip through to the lesson plan being given on that day and key in on the teacher 's thoughts and methodologies while watching that teacher perform his/her lesson even though teachers ( or at least THIS TEACHER ) happens to write a lesson plan and revise it ten times before the lesson ever makes it to the front of the classroom . Despite this fact , the unnamed `` they '' still want that lesson plan in that binder in that area of the classroom so that `` they '' have the security of knowing the secret failures and foibles of the teacher as he/she stands in front of the room of wide-eyed students and promptly forgets the lesson plan so neatly tucked in the binder . Thus , it is a mere statement of the obvious to say that while this process allows observers a great deal of security , it dooms the teacher to continual insecurity because `` they '' know everything that you are not doing because everything changes as soon as you begin doing it . The `` they '' say that it is to assure preparation . I say that the BINDER is the MAN . I know the MAN . Do you ?
