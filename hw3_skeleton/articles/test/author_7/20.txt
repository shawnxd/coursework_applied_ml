Hey ya 'll ! This week has been so boring . Except Friday . Friday was fun we went to Six Flags for our field trip . And I finally got over my fear or rollercasters ! Well I was never really scared of them ... since I had never been on one before ... I was just scared to go on them . But I had so much fun I went on Batman 3 times in a row . Ohmigosh we had like the worst bus lol . Kristina and Lynette got in this huge bitch fight . And Mrs. Hanley was on our bus ... ugh I hate her ! Everyone does ! And then last night I spent the night @ Sarah 's . And tomorrow is the last day of school ! And the recognition ceremony ! Yay ! It 's nice to have summer here I 'm just kinda sad that we are leaving middle school ! Ya IDK if I said this but I did find some good shoes to go with my dress ! Yay ! Well n e wayz I 'm gon na go now . Goin to bed early . Even though I just woke up from a nap . Ok nap ... that makes me sound like a 2 year old . Ok so I just woke up from crashing on my comfortable bed . That sounds a lil better . Whatever !
