I got a new toy ! Yay ! We went to True Value today ( there 's a Radio Shack in it ) and got my new cell phone . It 's an LG4600 , which is basically an upgrade of mi madre 's LG4400 . I did n't think I was gon na get it for another few days when I turn 16 and get my happy little license . I 'm busy going crazy trying to put everyone in my contacts now , though ; I 'm kinda alternating between the keyboard and the phone keypad at the moment . LOL ! Anyway , back to the cell ... Signing off , M .
