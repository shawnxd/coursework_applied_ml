Well , phase two was completed today on the zanny IloveBees countdown . The only noticable difference thus far is that the site is even more f***ed up than before . This is what got me tho . In Bungie 's weekly update , they specifically said , and I quote , `` An update for conspiracy theorists : I 've sorta been following the fuss â€“ too busy to really get into it , but Halo 2 will still release on Nov. 9th in the US and most other places , and Nov. 11th in the UK . Nor will we release a playable demo , anytime soon . In fact , we 're so busy with the game that there 's no chance we 'll even think about a playable demo until after Halo 2 ships . And that is official . It is n't happening folks . The game is however , happily on schedule for November 9th . '' ... so much for THAT little theory . All I have to say is thank Alah for no demo . But we are still all left to wonder what exactly will go down on the 24th . Time will tell obviously ... . No screenie today , sorry
