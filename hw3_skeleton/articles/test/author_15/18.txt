Time to bask the other game in a little beautiful light now . Halo 2 will be back probably the 24th when this whole conspiracy has cleared up . Fable . What can be said about such a wonderfully sexy game . It is nearly two months earlier on the release slate then Halo 2 . Now some may say , `` Oh , Fable sounds like a good game to tide myself over until Halo 2 's release . '' NO ! ! ... this would be a grave error in judgement . Fable is in it 's own class here and until KOTOR was released was a first in the emergent gameplay field . Oh ! Lucky you ! 5 new screenies were just released today from the game . And me , being the nice guy I am , will give you the nicest one . PS ... I just noticed that gamespot has an updated impressions article on the game . Read it urlLink here
