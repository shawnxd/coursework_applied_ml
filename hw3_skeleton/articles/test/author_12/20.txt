I am back from TIP now . It was my last time going , and I already miss it . The thing is that it has n't sunk in yet . I 've always wanted to stay there , but I do n't fully realize right now that I 'll never be able to go back . I 've always hated change ( probably the product of having divorced parents ) , and it bothers me that I wo n't be able to recreate TIP . I loved it ( and still love it ) there . While I was there , I finished Little . Big . It really is quite fantastic . I read a sizable amount ( ok , only a chapter or two ... ) outloud to my roommate because it was far too fantastic to keep quiet . After I finished that , I read The Gate to Women 's Country , a mediocre book I picked up from the free books pile at TIP . It was an ok examination of gender roles , but the dialogue was completely unrealistic and some of the descriptions were pretty cheesy . I have to read three poetry books for NOCCA , so I 'm halfway through 100 Selected Poems by EE Cummings . He really is fantastic . I 'll probably post a poem or two by him as examples , but not right now because I am lazy and do not feel like choosing them . Also , I have to write three poems before class starts . I 've got one and a half , so that third one will just have to come quick ( one is a response to Nostromo where I address Linda and the other is a piece of crap that I wrote at midnight when I found out that I needed to write three poems ) . Alright , I 'm tired ( ish ) and need to read . I 'll write more later .
