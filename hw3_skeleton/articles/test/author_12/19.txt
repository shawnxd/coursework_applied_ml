Ok , I 'm going to post the paper I got to write at TIP . Basically , it 's an analysis of what 's happening in Darfur , Sudan right now . It is slightly outdated because Congress recently defined the crisis as a genocide , but overall , the analysis is up to date . It disturbs me that someone , much less the entire world , would ignore this . The feeling I have is n't logical , and it is n't nice , and all I can think is that it shows that complacency is one of humanitys greatest faults . Rwanda should n't happen again . Genocide is genocide , and using other words to make it sound better is NOT acceptable . The biggest dissapointment in this whole thing is that even Amnesty International is afraid to call it a genocide . Everyone 's afraid . People are dying , and everyone 's too afraid to do something . It is n't fair . Here 's my paper ... Darfur : Genocide or Ethnic Cleansing ?
