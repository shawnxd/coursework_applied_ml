I emailed Amnesty International just now . I must say that I do n't understand . I mean , I understand the reasons , and I understand that politics are involved . I understand that countries are obligated to respond to genocide and do n't want AI saying its one . I understand that AI does n't want to lost credibility . I understand all that . What I do n't understand is how AI could do this . I do n't understand how people can make this decisions without hating themselves . People are being killed , and no one is doing anything . Yeah , right . Threaten sanctions . We do n't fucking trade with Sudan anyway , what good will that do ? If anything , it 'll block aid , and thats even worse . There 'll be a famine in Darfur soon because the Janjawid militia is burning crops and the region is subsitence farming . I can understand why countries are avoiding labelling it a genocide . I hate it , but I can understand it . What I can not understand is how AI is going along with this . Why are n't they speaking out ? I thought these were the people who devoted their lives to fighting for human rights . I thought that they would do better . This makes me sad .
