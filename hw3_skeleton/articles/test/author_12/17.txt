Yeah , the title sums up the contents of this post ... I 'm reading Girls on the Run by John Ashbery . Its a very strange book of poems , and it is confusing me right now . I 've finished the book of poems E.E . Cummings We 're fostering kittens right now . You ( being the void that I write to ) see , if a pregnant cat or very young kittens get taken to a shelter , they have to put them down because young kittens ' immune systems ca n't handle so many other cats . There 's this organization in my area called Friends of Jefferson Animal Shelter that works with the shelter to foster out pregnant cats and kittens . Here 's their website urlLink http : //www.petfinder.com/shelters/fjas.html . Right now , we 're taking care of a cat and her six kittens while the real person fostering them goes on vacation . The kittens ( and the mom ) are adorable , but I feel bad for the mom . She is so damn skinny , its a wonder she moves around . When you pet her , you can feel her spine and hips . The sad part is she probably wo n't start gaining weight until after the kittens stop nursing , and since they 're four weeks old , that may not be for a while . I 'll try to put up pictures of the kittens later ...
