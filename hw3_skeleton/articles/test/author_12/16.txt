Yes , this is time to explain how I am not very good with poetry . I 've read the book of E.E . Cummings poetry , and its great . Even I can see that . Still , I probably understood about 3/8ths of it for sure . Now , I 'm reading this book by John Ashbery , and it is WAY too confusing . Its called Girls on the Run , and I really do n't understand ANY of it . Well , at least I get to read The Ape Woman Story ( a book of poetry by Nancy Harris ) afterwards . I read the first poem , and I like her a lot more . I really do n't know why I 'm doing the poetry workshop . Well , yes I do . You see , I like nocca . I like reading the stuff they give me . I love the atmosphere . I love learning there . I 'd rather be taking Fiction , but if they make me take poetry instead , I 'll take it if it means I can keep going . Thats just how I am . Still , the next challenge will be to see if ... I can learn to understand and *gasp* write poetry . We shall see .
