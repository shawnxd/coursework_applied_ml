Wow . I just realized that there are comments on my blog ! So I guess I 'm no longer just talking to myself ... Hooray ! I set up blogger to email me when I get comments from now on ... which is certainly helpful . Knowing that at least a few people find my ramblings at least entertaining enough to read and comment on motivates me to maintain this blog with an increased frequency and vigor . Man , interactivity rules ! On another , perhaps anal note , I think that I need to add some links to the archives at the bottom of my blog template . I mean , there are links along the right side to access my archived blog entries by month , but once you scroll to the bottom of the page , you ca n't see that there are more posts available for perusing . Just a little something I noticed , which probably has a lot to do with my specialization in Human-Computer Interaction @ Tech . Yes , I am a geek , and I am not ashamed . Also , I 've been trying to get blogger to cooperate with me regarding date formats and the correct time zone . Hopefully I have n't managed to FUBAR my blog ... .
