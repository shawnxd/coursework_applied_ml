Check out this article , entitled urlLink Bike Writer Pedals for Protests , and be sure to watch the video . At first , I was a little confused by the article . The video really clarifies how cool Joshua Kinberg , the creator , is ... this project is his master 's thesis . The coolness factor of this project keeps compounding to a higher degree ! ! I need and want to read more about Kinberg 's project ... I think it could be wildly inspiring , which could n't come at a more perfect time for me ... I hope to discuss that at length later . However , I 'm not sure if I 'm ready to unveil all my thoughts online . See , I keep a separate journal on my iBook that is basically a private blog . That 's where I vent and reflect and ponder ... I 'm not sure if I 'm ready to completely surrender to the world of blogging yet . I do n't know if I can just release my wild , untamed thoughts to the world , even if only a few people see them . That 's something I 'm going to have to consider . I mean , I know that I 'll never release my iBook journal ( or any of my many handwritten journals ) unedited in its entirety -- because many of my entries are about things that I never talk to anyone about . I mean , it may sound crazy , but I feel like , via my journal I am able to work through my issues , concerns , thoughts , and what have you ... by having a discussion with myself . I 've kept a journal for years ... used to keep handwritten ones , and I recently found a neat little program called MacJournal that I really like . I mean , many of my journal entries are written as if I am talking to myself . And it works for me . So can I merge the two ? I do n't know . I think I need to find my own balance between the two . I do n't show ANYONE the contents of certain journal entries , simply because I allow myself complete freedom to ponder any and everything ( and I 'd be a little embarrassed for someone to see just how obsessive I can be ) . So I ca n't see revealing all my thoughts in a blog when I do n't share all my private journal entries with anyone but myself . Hmm ... much to ponder . My conclusion for now is that I 'd like to let go a little so that I can post more meaningful entries on my blog . Of course , not every entry will be moving/striking/whatever , but I know that I have more interesting things to say than the little tidbits I 've been posting . I now have a topic for reflection . And that rules .
