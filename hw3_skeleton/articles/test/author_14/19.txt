For some reason , I recently became convinced that my iBook was approaching its 3rd birthday . When my power adapter died this weekend , I began reconsidering how long I 've had it . So I dug into my iBook records and checked the receipt ... I bought it on 11/24/2002 , so I 've had my iBook about 20 months -- it 's not quite 2 yrs old . This seems important , primarily because I was thinking that my sweet little iBook was becoming a dinosaur ... I mean , it performs excellently to this day ( aside from the dead power adapter I had to replace today -- which had some cool side-effects -- see today 's earlier entry ) ... but I was thinking that it was getting up there in the years , so far as technology lifespans go . Anyhoo ... while my iBook may be `` middle aged , '' it 's still a fresh-faced youngster to me ; )
