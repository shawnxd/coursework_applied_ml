Okay , so while I am behind the times ( or so I 've heard ) with regards to friendster and other cool web-connect sites ... I still think it 's pretty cool . If you 've not heard of it or checked it out , you really should ! It 's a neat way to connect with people you have n't talked to in awhile or to feel cool by seeing how many friends you can get . One of the things that I think is really neat is that it shows you how many 1st , 2nd , and 3rd degree friends you have . So you can start your own version of `` 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon '' with your friends , only it 's 3 degrees of { insert your/friend 's name here } . Pretty cool .
