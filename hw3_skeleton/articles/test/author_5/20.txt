On Saturday ( 2 days ago ) I was helping my dad do rotatilling the back yard we were taking turns it was 95 out side we did it for 6 hours and even today I 'm still sore , from sun burns and muscle pain the rotatiller that had was 5.5 hp and only had 2 wheels so the blades were the part the was dragging you around we both were having trouble handling it what was worse was that the clutch would get stuck on so I could n't stop the blades some times so both of us were scrambling to stop it and of course the on/off switch is on the front one of the times my dad was in getting a drink it decided to take off and I was trying to hold it back from eating the massive rose bush that was right in front needless to say I had to have it dig in so that it could n't go any were so I could reach the front and turn it off so that was an long day.. it my littlest sisters 11th birthday so ( if any one even reads this ) feel free to post a `` happy birthday '' comment : ) and I have an eye appointment to get some new glasses because one of my friends dog chewed one lens then I lose it 'nuff said there
