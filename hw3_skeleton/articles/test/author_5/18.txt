Well this week has been very chaotic and filled with events most of them centered on my parents `` renewing of the vows '' getting ready to have a party at are house was very tiresome in light of all this ( or darkness hehe ) my dad bought Doom 3 in the time we got it to just about 10 mins ago I played it until I finished it which was roughly 48 hours of gaming thur the span of 4 days I think the game was awesome scared the crap out of me several times , one of the monsters that probably the most scariest is the bug-baby thing it always seamed to jump in my face with out me knowing were it was and every time I knew it was close I would get goose-bumps my dad played it a while have n't heard his opinion on the game but my sister tried to venture into the game she though it was cool and liked it but the first time she played it she came up to me and said `` Oh my GOD that game is FREAKING PHYCO '' I think she meant by insanely scary at the time there were only zombies hehe the first big night I played it I had nightmares of the zombies although my system is n't the best one to play it I was able to get medium and 800x600 just fine and 1024x768 if I wanted to play with a lot of `` chunky play '' the game atmophere is very vivid and scary a lot of audio that sets the mood and sounds from near by monsters also makes it very interesting ( the sounds of the bug-baby give me goose-bumps : \ ) the story was cool and the PDA stuff did give a lot info into the story I never did play doom or doom 2 but it does n't really matter because doom 3 takes place before those the only real bads were that the physics were kinda weird like a lot of friction was applied to everything and that gameplay was n't all that , there were hardly any puzzles to do go to place-find key or PDA-open door-kill everything-boss-repeat the only real unique thing was the interactive panels were when you got close were you looked is were your mouse went and you can click on things that way and the buttons did do a lot of things that interacted with the environment another thing was kinda cool ( and kinda mind challenging how they did it ) was the camera in/out . There was one instance were the camera was looking at the monitor it was displaying on so it was `` hall of mirrors '' effect now the problem of this is that it should of gone forever and the game would lockup and eventually crashed maybe it 's a simple cap .. now for some hl2 news ! the cs : s beta has been delayed know one knows why or how long it will be delayed for but by the sound of it its a few evil bugs that just wo n't die not much else has gone on in the hl2 world my game I working on is really doing well in the design stage I 've got tons of txt files and papers on my desk and in the folder it just seams to get better and better when I thing longer I think eventually I going to stop thinking and start coding I 'll set the date at Set at the 15 of august gives me a week to clean up my txt files and papers and put them all onto one clean essay the plan is then go to the pb forums and ask a few people to help : ) if no one wants to help ( which I dought there very good people ) I do it all by my self in that case it will be considerable longer ... ~Dreglor
