For some odd reason my watch died ( battery 's ) today it was nice my parents say there going to get a new battery 's I not sure if that 's going to happen in the mean while I will wonder thru my life clueless to the time , and try to fill the `` skin shadow '' from the watch : ) half life 2 seams to be coming along according to gabe Newell ( co-founder , project manger ? ) there was a mention of a demo after the game is sent to the publisher maybe before hl2 is out : ) that would be great my dad wants to get cs : cz because a cs : s beta will be coming soon and it will be coming to cs : cz people I would n't blame him because getting to at least see what the engine is capable of is bone chilling : ) doom 3 seams to be shipping currently , but I 'm not exactly running to grab a copy the game seams to be super remake of the other 2 gore/scare-fest with little story dungeon siege 2 wo n't be out until December ... But it looks sweet : D if you look at the games now they shifted from polygons to shaders and physics have just made a big ripple before physics were a dream because CPU was still a major rendering factor even with 3d cards now since 3d cards really pull about 80 % of rendering it frees up a lot of stuff for AI or physics now every programmer knows that AI should n't take all ( even if it 's pretty advance it still comes down to if and else statements ) so physics now take the leftover which is more repetive because physics can be explained pretty easily to computers because its basically math the only hard part is optimizing it well that 's pretty much it have a nice week to who all that reads this ( if any )
