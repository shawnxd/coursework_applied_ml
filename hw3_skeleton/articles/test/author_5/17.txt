I find odd things on the internet , like people purposely ( for fun of course ) jumping in the way of there buddies car `` Never under estimate stupid people in large groups '' if I ever had a motto this would be it ... I saw a another 's persons blog were he was really angry he like 14 and hates him self and everything around him . he was truly evil ... I think he 's parents never loved him , honestly . people like him should really try to look at the world another way before jumping : well of note , I had fun at fourth of July setting of colorful explosives is always fun my sisters birthday rolled by nice cake : ) while were on the subject girls around her age ( maybe others ) are either on guy surfari ( literally ) or depressing them selves kinda odd or normal I really wish I ca n't help people like them but in most cases I ca n't bummer tho ' hmm this blog is making me hunger for food : P
