a precarious silence has befallen my humble abode ... as long as i am PERFECT my mom will not explode . there is an almost unbearable tension , a springloaded landmine that could go off whether someone steps on it or not . i dont care , im ready for this drama to be gone , and im almost curious as to what would happen if i were to THROW the shit in the fan instead of waiting ... haha . oh well , jenn is coming back today from camping so im exited about that and my mom is leaving all day so i am blessedly alone ! ALL DAY ! ! this is wonderful , im gon na have jake over and we 'll jam ... ( him on drums , me on piano , loads of fun ) ... oh that reminds me , my piano broke , the pedal on the far right doesnt sustain the notes anymore , it doesnt do anything anymore ... this is quite sad . but oh well , im happy , in a very good mood , a wonderful way to start the day off if i cant say so myself , the prospect of swing dancing tonight is lovely , i havent been in ages , and Jenn seeing Jenn tonight would be absolutely wonderful ... so whether i see jenn or go swing dancing , my night is gon na be awesome , and my day is looking good as well . i leave for L.A on wednesday ( i HATE typing wednesday ) and im really exited about that , leaving again kinda sucks , but it will be a much needed break from my mom , and i think my mom might even need this more than me ... hahaha things are swell , as long as i can keep my focus and continue to look at the whole picture i should be fine .
