for a night owl , my nights have been quite shity lately , with the exeption of last night . why is it i always have to come home to bitching ? ? i think it is unhealthy to want to flee a place you live in , and i want to flee desperatly . and having things be so splendid outside of home and in other aspects of my life doesnt help ... . blah , i make myslef so bloody tense ! ! i do it all to myself , i know i do . its amusing , i really couldnt wish for things to be better , i mean things in friend zone are ... brilliant , and i feel SO good around her , mmmm i love being a corny sentimental romantic `` doofus '' im just letting things go ... . not like work wise or responsibility wise , im just gon na let my life take me where i need to go , i dont want to wake up when im 30 and realise im in a place i dont want to be , im gon na book it with my school shit and keep up for bloody once , i want my mom off my back , and i want to do well on my own , again for once , see what i can really do without support ... i guess i just want a lil room to breathe , room to make my own mistakes and learn from them . i want to live a life without a cushon to fall back on , a cushion that can at times be lined with nails . AAH my life is scattered and collected , i feel like a big contradiction . im happy though , through it all , and im pretty sure ill stay that way ... this is the strangest thing ... i get home happy , come upstairs , get online , get depressed and angry , and then it melloes out and i feel really good , for no apparent reason or for very obvious reasons , this is so strange . i feel good . **two minutes later** mildly curious ponderings of blue brown eyes ... . should feelings flashed for instants in distant chapters blur and slip away when chances were the author was distorted ? a blind painter , a poet without imagination ? one can not make the ink wet again ... reshape and manipulate what has already been written to suit present pretences ... just turn the page man ... chill .
