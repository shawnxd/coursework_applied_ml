i think its amazing how music can completely alter ones mood ... last night i was listening to the requiem for a dream main theme , and though it is beautiful , it is quite sad , and i was depressed for the first time in a really long time last night , and , as opposed to carying over into the next day , ( as my music listening tendancies usually do ) i woke up this morning with the relazation that , i was really happy ! no actually i just needed to practice the piano really bad because my piano teacher was going to be here in 20 minutes ... but the song i was playing is just so beautiful , its a theme from amelie : Comptine D'un Autre Été : L'après Midi , and this song is georgeous , ah the whole amelie soundtrack , though musically challenging , is so beautiful i just cant stand it and it was at THIS point i realized that most of the depression i feel is rather self inflicted , sometimes inspired by depressing music , OR music that has bad connatations to it . now , the requiem for a dream soundtrack has lovely connatations tied along with it but the song is just too damn sad to listen to as often as i was ... with my sensitive psyche ... it just wasnt a good thing for me to do , and it spoiled my wonderful afternoon , ah.. c'est la vie i suppose ( my french speling is SO BAD ) and its all good now i guess , im glad i feel better , last night was ... haha rather dismal . people were there for me though so thats enough to make anyone feel great regardless of self inflicted depression or otherwise , and im glad i have the people i do ... thanks guys . **sniff**
