i mentioned earlier an experience i had with a skirt that got my mom all in a tiff , and i think it may have left me in a bit of a precarious position ... im not trans-sexual , ill just get that out of the way right now ... and though i can be rather feminine sometimes , im not gay either , i used to wonder if perhaps i was bi ... but for the most part guys are pigs and though some are attractive , i wouldnt date them , it just seems off to me . growing up with a lesbian mother has givin me a gift of open mindedness so i have absolutely nothing against gays lesbians bi or trans-gender/sexual people , but i guess it just isnt for me . however , i am open to new things , almost anything ( i find it ironic i have been raised in such an open and alternitive home and yet i am being accosted for looks and womens clothes ... hmmm ) and i like close fitting clothes . so ... eventually a time came where i had the , oppurtunity , to wear this really litle pink shirt that said `` i kiss boys '' in really glittery letters . my friend liz and poppy bought it for me and so just for the hell of it i wore it to school one day . i go to a pretty rockin school and so i didnt get any shit , and this shirt was small ... like mid driff and just the whole deal , yeah some guys looked at me wierd , but i actually got s lot of compliments , and this started a chain reaction of sorts . a few days later , another female friend of mine gave me yet another small pink shirt , and , again i wore it at school , same reaction pretty much , oh if you want to see what i look like , to try and imagine me in a pink shirt ( who wouldnt want to imagine a guy in a small pink shirt ? ? ) there are pictures of me in an online photo album at : http : //www.sonoma.edu/users/n/niemann/Travels/Travels.html so anyway this pink tradition lasted for a few more shirts , and then it died . but now i , when the time came , would be ready for the next step . **bum bum bumm** the next step came a few weeks later when i was hanging out with some friends of mine ( and this kind of random guy that was a friend of my friend ) and we all decided , ( well me and wei decided ) to dress me and n*** up in girl clothes and go to a local chill cafe and walk around and make idiots of ourselfs ... ( sounds like fun ... eh ? ) so we did and we had a ball , it was like 10:00 pm so it was dark and stuff , it was just really cool and funny ... lots of fun . now about the skirt in the car my mom found , this was the first ( and only ) skirt i had ever worn , it was my friend liz 's and she gave it to me as a gift , to remember and all that jazz . so yeah i wore that to the cafe with my friends and had jenn hold onto it because i had to leave right when we got back ( i have an 11:00 pm curfew ) and she had it at her house for weeks afterwards . when she gave it back to me i left it in the car and my mom found it ... of course she found it 2 days after our fight with the eyeliner , and so i walk in the door at 11:15 with eye liner on and my mom had this skirt ... doesnt look to good . so its ok i guess , now she just sees me as a twisted trans-gender fairy freak crank user , its all good , im happy with who i am , its a lil ironic because im not really any of those things . oh well . she 'll get it some day . sorry this was so bloody long ...
