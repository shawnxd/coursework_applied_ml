Psych , Part VII Sunday , April 16 I am on the second day of new medication . It seems ok though I am really drowsy in the morning and I can feel the medicine as it the level drops . One of them has made my blood pressure lower . I have been moved out of the observation unit and now am in a regular room . That bothered me at first but I am feeling a little better about that now . The room is nice with two sets of drawers , a wardrobe an desk . the view from the window is another part of the building but that is ok . I have been a bit angrier this time because part of me feels like I should n't be here because so many of the others are from more difficult backgrounds than I am . Sometimes that makes me feel more guilty . I suddenly feel like I ca n't handle anything which definetly not how I have been up until this point in my life . I may not have handled it well-but I always handled it . I need to believe that I can get back to that point and want to get back there . Right now it seems very comfortable being here-having others watch out for me , not having to deal with life and any of its responsibilities and that ca n't continue . Either I have to get better or I have to kill myself and I think deep down I want the former and just need to be more patient . Monday , April 17 I am really agitated and angry . One fo the patients has continually disrupted every session today . I did speak up about this but I am not sure whether or not this will be address with him . then I am pretty angry about A 's behavior . I realize that she is ill , but then we all are , yet she continually has to have the limelight . She has lots of stuff and makes sure that she offers it to all her buddies . Though I try not to let this bother me it does make me fell left out . Then I just watched her completely ignore another patients ' attempts to get to speak to a doctor . I know she 's excited about getting out but she 's being a real pain . Well writing and talking to B has calmed me down a bit . The doctor has added one more dose of Seroquel to see if it will take care of my afternoon problems . They have also put me on a special diet to make sure I am getting enough to eat . The other thing that would probably help would be some constant nice weather . It keeps getting hot and cold and it seems to always be raining . Tuesday , April 18 I just realized I stopped soing my three things , it got to be too much . It 's alot quieter today because C left . She was very kind and kind of watched out for everyone . I just spoke to the doctor and he said I may be getting out tomorrow . I feel pretty good this morning and feel like I might be ready to go home and take care of things . I need to discuss with P. that I ca n't go back to `` norma '' so quickly . He 'll need to help me with bills and stuff a little more . Saturday , April 22 I left the hospital on Wednesday . I am feeling better this time . The medication does not make me quite as drowsy as the other did . I also have ( hopefully ) more realistic expectations of what things will be like . Last time I expected everything to be back to normal but it did n't happen that way and it wo n't be that way this time either . Thursday and Friday I did n't do much of anything but bills . Today we cleaned the first floor . It was the first real cleaning I have done in a while . On Wednesday before I left we had a `` women 's group . '' During the session one of the other patients talked about how could she get out of the cycle of being homeless and on the streets . She has been in foster homes since she was 9 or 10 ( she 's 19 now ) . She also described how as an 8 yr old she would be terrified if her mother left for work before she was awake . ( She had to get herself ready for school . ) When she was talking about this I suddenly realized how G. would feel if I were to kill myself . G. had been raised with yelling and that this needs to change . Monday , April 24th I spent much of the day at work trying to upgrade software . I felt pretty good today . Not too sleepy or confused . However I went grocery shopping and thought about suicide again . I also did n't do very well-I forgot part of what I was supposed to buy . P. mowed the lawn and I raked it . I was pretty tired after dinner . Tuesday , April 25th I have been drowsy and addled today . I have gotten better as the day has progressed but am still not really with it . B. said I looked really good . I only wish I felt as good as I look . I am supposed to choose a psychiatrist today . I hate the thought of doing this . Dr. P. is really nice , but I also see S. 's point about Dr. S. knowing me better . Dr. M. agreed that he is probably a better choice too . I feel like I have been put in a spot .
