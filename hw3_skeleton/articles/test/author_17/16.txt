Psych , Part IX Thursday , May 25th , 2000 The last week has had its ups and downs . I felt really bad yesterday afternoon but I took an extra Seroquel and then slept and I got through it . S. and Dr. P. both say that it will be hard getting through this but I have to go through it to get better . I feel ok or good more than I did for the past couple of months , but when I feel bad it is still really bad . Work has been good because I ( we ) have been working to get all the books rebarcoded so it will make inventory easier and I have to concentrate on that , but when I get out of work I think about things and my mind starts thinking about all the things I need to do and how I wo n't have enough time to do them . I also get angry and upset about the way I am feeling . People tell me it will get better buth they have n't been through it and I wonder how many people do n't actually get through it . I have now put on 8 lbs-almost all in my belly . I thought I would n't mind but I do . My hips and thighs are also `` looser '' than they were . It 's not bad enough that I have to feel bad , then middle age starts to kick in . This weekend will be the first time I will be with alot of my family-it will be interesting to see what happens . Most of the time I am ok with babies but I still get some pangs when I think about it . Tuesday , May 30 , 2000 As I am watching this show , I 'm having alot of different feelings . I am angry because the show has been on and people might know what I have done . People who try to kill themselves or who hurt themselves are crazY ! They make it look so romantic but it 's not . She talked about her mother doing things and buying things but only trying to be a good mom and I think thta is probably how I am . I also understand about the control-when I do n't have razors or pills I feel like I have no control , but when I have them it is my decision . I also know that in the movie everything will turn out all right and I do n't know if it will for me . My family has been good about making me not feel guilty about how I have made them fell but I still feel bad . And when I think aobut what made me like this and think it might have something to do with Memere it makes me feel worse . I have felt better for the past week but today ( tonight ) I have felt really bad . I probably should n't be watching this but I have to because I keep thinking it will help me somehow but maybe it will only make things worse . It says that the medicine will not give her side effects which is n't true . She seems so wimpy , I wonder if that is what I 'm like-I guess I probably am . The movie said that self-injury can cause psychological damage but I though it was a symptom not a cause ?
