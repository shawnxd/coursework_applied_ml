Psych , Part VI Tuesday , April 4th I need to catch up since Friday . When I saw S. she suggested a book to get to read which I picked up last night . I feel a little funny about reading like somehow if I read it I wiil get in on some kind of secret and I wo n't get better . Saturday we did some cleaning . It was really nice out and while Peter and Garrett ran errands I got a little gardening done and I read two chapters for class . Over the weekend I decided I will accept a place in the Master 's program at Uconn . Saturday night we went to Mom and Dad 's for dinner and cake and coffeee . I got some very nice things . Sunday we went out to dinner with my parents and P. 's bothers and Dad and E. It was very nice . I did n't think I would like it as well as I did . P. did some very nice things for me this weekend . I just wish I could be better for him . Yesterday I was very agitated all day . I did get some work done and at home I picked up a bit and did laundry . I also did the grocery shopping . While I was shopping I bought razorblades . I was a little nervous about buying them , I thought someone would know what they were for , but just having thme made me feel better , like I had some control back . I did cut myself , I 'll have to be careful , because they cut very easily . Today , I am feeling better than I did yesterday . I am a bit self-conscious about my arm because I am wearing something short-sleeved , but noone has said anything . I am a bit worried about what will happen when I go see Dr. P. on Thursday . I am going to try to make arrangements in case I have to go back to the hospital . It 's somewhat comforting to thnk about going back but I would n't want all that medication again . I 'll just have to see what happens . Saturday , April 8th I have n't been taking time for myself or writing everyday . I cut myself again on Tuesday night . Garrett had gone to visit with A. I cut pretty deep and it took me about 15 minutes to get it to stop bleeding . On Wednesday , the school nurse put a butterfly bandage on it . When I went to see Dr. P. on Thursday he made a good point . I cut myself because I was angry because I could n't get things done for P. and G. but cutting myself did not make that better . I gave him the blades and felt safer . On Friday S. pointed out that cutting was an addiction like a drug . Even though they wer both right I still have wanted to cut myself and today I felt like killing myself . I am feeling better-the thoughts are not constand but they do come and go . If I cut myself again I am supposed to write down the `` trail '' of thoughts that lead to cutting . When we got home from the Pinewood Derby I had a snack then went for a bike ride . It was really hard getting up the hill and now it is too windy and P. will come get me but it did help the bad feelings go down a bit . Sometimes I feel like a little kid . I passes a student who graduated in January . As I passed her I thought how mature and stable she seems . Even at school I always felt that she was the adult and I was the child . I really envy her . I have tried to pinpoint what makes me feel so bad but I just start thinking about one thing and it leads to another until it is too overwhelming and I feel like I ca n't stand it anymore . My mother asked if she could talk to S. about what I have . I have n't told her the new diagnosis , I do n't really want to . I feel very ashamed of it , like I ca n't control myself like other adults do . I felt bad for S. this week . She seemed to have a busy week and seemed tired . I felt bad telling her all this stuff since she had such a week . I feel like I am always complaining and never finding anything good but there to be some good things . This morning as we were leaving Foxy climbed a tree to catch something and then jumped down again . It was pretty funny to watch . She 's really a good cat and spends a lot of time with me . Skittles is good too but she is much more independent . It has felt good sitting in the sun all day . I stopped by the stream on the way up and listened for a while . It was very soothing and I was tempted to take my shoes and socks off and put my feet in because the water did n't feel too cold . I just saw someone I know ( but do n't recognize ) with her two boys ( about 2 ) . A wave of darkness came over just like earlier today at the Derby with all those people seeming so happy and normal like I want to be again ! Nobody has any idea how bad I feel and none understand . I just want to know that this will get better ! Wednesday , April 12 The week has not been good . I am finding it more difficult to concentrate on anything . Monday I went shopping and bought more razors . Today has been the first day I have really felt like cutting myself . On Monday evening I spent about an hour with my Ativan debating whether or not to take it . I felt there were few things left to do . I am more prepared today . I am still not sure I have enough to do more than put me ina comea-I was angry with Dr. P on Monday because he only gave me 14 . I got more reading done and have completed my application acceptance . However I do n't believe I will be able to do my presentation next week as scheduled . Since G. stated taking his allergy medicine he seems much better . He is sleeping better and his attitude is better . P. is getting nervous about work again . They will have a meeting on Friday when he will find out what is going on . I did n't handle that as well as I would have liked last time and this time I am not sure I can handle it all . I feel like everything at home is back to normal except me . I do n't wnat to have to think about things like the bills , insurance , etc . It 's just all too frustrating . And then I come to work and feel like I do little . I am not really teaching . I doubt I am affecting any of the kids . I know I should n't cut but right now it is the only way I can feel better . I do n't know what I 'll do at S. 's today . If I tell her she will take these things from me and I wo n't have control again . R. said he thought if I killed myself that God would still love me but he thought I would have be held accountable for what happened here . I do n't think it would be too bad here-people would get along without me . I just want to leave a few instructions so things go smoothly . Thursday , April 13 I am back at Natchaug which is good because I feel safe . I know that I ca n't really follow through on thoughts of hurting myself . I 'm angry with myself for not following through and I am still having trouble with givving S. the pills . Right now it is nice just to sit and not have to think . Friday , April 14 They have let me off constant observation so I will be able to go down and get dinner and go out on the unit I met with Dr. S today and along with changing my meds ( again ) he also said a couple of things which seemed to make sense and have put a little twinge into me . First he said that it sounded like I was feeling a little sorry for myself and he 's right . He also said I have to work on getting better . He said it wo n't be easy , but I have to do it . I guess the first thing made more of an impression . I need to adapt to things and get going or I will never be back to where I used to be or maybe I do n't want to be and that 's the whole point .
