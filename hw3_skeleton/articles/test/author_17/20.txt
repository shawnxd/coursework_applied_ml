Well , last night was pretty wild . I had been doing very well , even cutting the Paxil dose in half . I got through the funeral alright and Sunday went well . But last night was a hell night . Nightmares all night-terrible horrifying ones , not I went to work with no clothes on , but nightmares involving maiming , killing , sick to my stomach ones . I ca n't remember them this time , which I have n't decided is good or bad , but thinking about them now turns my stomach . These were mixed in with what my psychmd calls `` waking dreams . '' Others might call them hallucinations . I have had these for years even before I was diagnosed . Some are pleasant-beautiful flowers growing from the walls , some are horrible-individuals intent on harming me , my husband , or my son . Last nights were of the latter . I only remember one , it was a glowing , writhing , colorful knot at the end of the bed which I could not get by without getting hurt . I have a very good husband who helps me wake up and calm down . I do n't usually tell others about these , because they might think I was really off my rocker . When I finally woke up this morning I was sick to my stomach with a headache and fever , I 'm hoping it was all a result of the fever . I recently discovered a website where sterling silver ribbon pins can be purchased . Wearing these help raise awareness of mental illnesses and how common they are . ( 1 out of every 5 Americans will be treated for a mental disorder this year-which means you probably know 1 or 2 . ) The website is urlLink Narsad Artworks .
