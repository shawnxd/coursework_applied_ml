hola , it 's me again ... news-flash ! joel is so bored that he 's relegatin the better part of an hour 2 typin his pathetically limited thoughts down in this blog of his ... what m i thinkin ? nothing much really..i was simply wondering how long this torture of studyin has 2 last..i know , i know , probably my whole life..after all , as some wise- @ $ $ folks say ; learning is n ongoing process.. *grimaces* this is the truth about life : you have two choices ~ you can either go through life dwelling on everything , letting every bad thing that happens bring you down that much more , letting everytime someone hurts you , everytime someone lets you down , everytime someone does n't care when they say they do - you can let that all ruin you ... you can let it tear you apart inside..heck ! it 's easy too ... or , you can take the high road : you can look back on high school , on the mean things you 've done , on the mean things people have done to you , and you can try to learn something ... you can learn lots from your past if you 're willing to just look ... i 've learnt not to let the fact that i think someone 's smarter than me , make me think they 're better than me ... i 've learnt no matter how beautiful someone is on the outside , that 's nothing next to being a caring , warm , friendly , comforting , reliable , trustworthy person ... i 've learnt never to let go of what i really believe , to never give in to people who do n't want anything but the best for me . i 've learned that in this world , there 's only one person i 'm responsible for , one person i can change , one person i can always count on - me ... .= ) urs truly , me
