Hav u ever realized that people always create a there instead of a here ... for example , u r on a hike and u have a destination of geting there ( the top of the hill ) so u make it your point , once i get there i 'll b happy , but then u get there and soon u realize that ur here has vanished and u create another there , once i get back i 'll b happy , n once u get there ... .it 's the same , u create another there ... .humans are like this they 're never here , there always there . so u have to realize that ur whole life will be a there when u have to live now n not later ... .u must stop living there and start living here , or ur life will pass u by , and u 'll b still living in a there world until u die , so what da heck m i talking about ? ! oh well , that 's all 4 now.. urs truly , me = )
