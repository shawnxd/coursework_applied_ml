`` I got oceans of time , but I cant swim '' - That is the best way to describe what I feel like ... I always knew so well what to do with my time , but lately , lots of stuff has changed . Its like my life is n't my life anymore . At least not the way I expected my life to be ... O well , today was father 's day , but I didnt had a present : ( he 'll get it when I buy it for him someday ; ) we where gone to my grandparents all day and I just came home ... It was a nice day ... I drunk beer for the first time in my life today ... I had lots of breezers and stuff before , but never a beer , it tasted funny . My dad didnt think I would really do it , and called me a bluffer , but I drank it till the last little drop : D felt kinda sick afterwards though , cause I hadnt eaten anything before it ( I have a weird day , I 'm not hungry , all I ate was a cracker and a lolly ; ) ) I 'm afraid of tomorrow , I thought I could like , handle it , but I dont think I can ... I 'm in a dillemma : `` To go , or not to go , thats the question '' But I 'll just have to go : ( `` Evanesence - Everybody 's fool '' is like my favorite song right now . I got ta try getting it on mp3 ; ) although I like `` addicted '' of `` simple plan '' a lot too ... I dunno what it is , the last year , my interest for music has grown ... I never liked music , now I cant live without . All off the sudden I do n't like the vacation no more.. Please , please let me goto school in tha vacation ! may sound stupid , but I just dunno what to do ... maybe I 'm just gon na learen myself how to skateboard , or I 'm gon na buy me a pair of rollerblades or sumting ... . I heard they are quite popular again , and it gives me sumting to do too : ) well , I dont like wasting ur time any more , so I 'm gon na stop typing . Bye .
