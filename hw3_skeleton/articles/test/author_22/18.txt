Hello peoplez , itsa me again ! yesterday and today I was @ my grandparents 's so I was n't online ... Have n't chatted with peoplez for like 4 dayz now , except for a brief moment with vince and a guy called tarik . Anywayz , its been great fun the last 2 dayz , but sadn @ tha same time . I had a really weird dream about Danique last night . We where doing all kinds of stuff together , but something everytime went wrong and just before I woke up , she walked off with vince ... ok , I know that doesnt make any sence whatsoever , but it still made me feel very sad . What made me happy again was my grandpa trying to computer XP it just so rules to see him trieing and trieing over again : ) ok , enough happy things.. gon na wait till my dad leaves the house , then I 'm gon na cry my eyeballs out cause of tha stupid dream ( I did n't had the time to do that yet XP ) peace out
