Hey ! My weekend was pretty good . My mom and I drove down on Friday night and it was stormy , and we got there and I found a lot of girls on my soccer team . We all got in our bikinis and hung out at the pool and met some guys that were at a State Track Meet . They were really hot , with ripped stomach muscles , and prolly 16 or 17 . We saw them again later , and everyone was playing it all cool as we flirted with them , and I had to be dumb and blurt out , `` Why is your shirt on ? ! '' I 'm just too cool ... . On Saturday , we lost two games which sucked cuz the teams we palyed were n't good , but we were missing people and dying from the heat , lol ... anyways , then my mom took me shopping and I got lipgloss and perfume from Bath and Body Works , 5 thongs @ Victoria 's Secret , a pair of capris and a belt from Abercrombie , a button-up white striped shirt from American Eagle , and two books : Wicked and Falling Angels . Then , that night we all met some guys our age who had a b-ball tourney . They were from Lacrosse , Wisconsin , and they were nice . We got there screen-names and Breanna , Amanda , Emily G. , Christine , and I went to their room and watched 50 First Dates with them . It was fun . Then today , we checked out of the hotel , and my mom and I did a little more shopping and I got a tank top . Then my mom and I went to the movie , `` Saved ! '' It was funny , about a school of Jesus-freaks and the main character , Jena Malone , gets pregnant , and Mandy Moore makes her life hell . Then we had a soccer game and I played forward and I scored the first goal of the tourney , and then made an assist with Kayley Malban for the second/last goal . Winning that game got us third place in the tourney and we got these big , gaudy medals ... then my mom and I drove home and here I am ! ! Love , Keely
