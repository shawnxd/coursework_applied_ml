School is over and summer is here ! I 'm lovin ' it ! Yesterday , I did n't cry at school , but I did when I got home , thinking about how middle school ended and stuff ... tonight I have a party and a sleepover , and tomorrow I have a soccer game . Yesterday I hung out with Nikita and watched a soccer game ! I love summer ! ! ! **Keely**
