Hey , I 'm going down to the Cities today for a soccer tourney all weekend ... I 'm so busy with soccer all of the time ; it 's crazy ! I have n't hung out with any of my friends other then my soccer friends much , but I did hang out with Austin and my neighbor/friend , Joe Serre . He 's a cool kid , and it 's fun to have a friend close by . He 's a cutie , too . Well , I got ta go ! More when I get home from the Cities ... **Keely**
