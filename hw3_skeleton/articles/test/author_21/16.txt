Every once and a while during the summer I think about the coming school and it gives me shivers . This year , for me , will be the hardest and probably the most stressful year of high school yet . I 've got a heavy academic course load and I 'm taking Bio 12 and French 12 , which are both really hard provinical examable courses . The work will be tough , but for me , the worst part is the stress of trying to do well enough to get into commerce at Queen 's . The weirdest part is I do n't really want to go all the way out to Ontario for school , I 'd much rather go to SFU or UBC here in BC . I 'm not sure why I feel pressured to go to Queen 's because my dad said he did n't care where I went or if I went to university at all . Anyways , I 'm also gon na be working a lot to get some money for school . So I think the thing I most worried about this year is not having the time to see the people I care about . This post is kinda boring , so I 'm off and next time I 'll think of something really cool to write bout . Cheers , Mick
