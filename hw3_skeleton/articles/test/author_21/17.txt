First things first , I love my friends and I 'd do anything for them . There all great and amazing in their own ways . It these guys and girls who make my life so special and amazing . Pretty much to some up my friends there are three groups . The first group is the people I hang out with pretty much all the time . Everyone in the group is really open with each other and everyone is relaxed around each other . For the most part I could see these people 24/7 and never get tired of them . The second group of people consists of pretty much just one girl and whoever she happens to be hanging out with at the time . I love hanging out with her when I do n't feel like doing anything or when I need a little break from some of the people from the first group . Some of my friends think she really boring , and I sort of do to , but it all depends on the mood your in , when you feel like just relaxing and doing nothing then shes the best person to be around . Also because I do n't see her that often I do n't really know her well enough to say whether she is boring or not , plus i do n't think I 've hung out with her in the daytime . Okay , the third and final group is the group of friends who I do n't see very often and I always see them when I 'm hanging out with friends from the first group . Anyways , thats all my friends . There are a few special friends in that first group who I 'm gon na talk about a little more . The first is a girl who I feel comfortable telling her anything and everything , shes also really good at reading me if somethings wrong and she never bugs me . The second is another girl who I 've pretty much seen all summer , I 've been a lot of time with her and shes super nice , I 've never met a nicer girl in my whole life . The third is a guy who I feel comfortable talking about issues and stuff with , hes a great guy and hes super fun to hang out with . The final person is my girl , shes amazing and I feel completely comfortable around her , she can read me better than anyone else and knows if somethings wrong , she also really cute . Anyways , thats my friends for ya . Cheers , Mick
