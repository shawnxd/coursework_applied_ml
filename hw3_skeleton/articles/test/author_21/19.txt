Now for those of you who have been drinking you hopefully know what I mean when i say babysitter . The babysitter is that friend who does n't drink but goes with you when you go drinking . They 're there to have fun and keep everyone safe . There are a few rules that all babysitters should follow though . The most important rule is never to make the people drinking feel like there doing something wrong or that they 're making you uncomfortable . So try not to look bored or uncomfortable and do n't be critical of the people driking . However , if they are doing something wrong or something that makes you uncomfortable let them know about it , honesty is important , and your all friends anyways . Another important rule to being a babysitter is not to act stupid , if other people are acting stupid its because they 're drunk so they have an excuse to act stupid , you 're not drunk so you 've got no excuse to act stupid . So never asks the people drinking stupid questions or try and get them to do stupid things . They may be too drunk to care about what your doing or saying at the time but they 'll remember in the morning and be annoyed . A babysitter should also make everyone feel comfortable , sometimes people drinking can feel akward if you ( the babysitter ) are not drinking , so just grab a beer and spend the night sipping on it . When you 're done with it just carry around the empty bottle and people will think your still drinking . If you really really do n't want to drink just grab an empty and fill it with water , no one can tell whether or not its beer inside because of the coloring on the bottle . However , some bottles are clear so make sure you only use Smirnoff bottles to fill with water ( cause all Smirnoff stuff is clear anyways ) . Follow these rules and you 'll make everyone feel relaxed and you can also make sure they 're all safe . Cheers , Mick
