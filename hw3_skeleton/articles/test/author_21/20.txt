About three months ago I had way to much to drink , seven beers and a shot of hard bar . Anyways I threw up a bunch of times and probably acted like a total idiot , but the worst part is not being able to remember doing anything of the things people said I did . Also thinking about how my friends and more importantly my girlfriend felt while I was passed out with vomit on my shirt . I guess I feel bad because i kinda killed there fun and they all had to take care of me instead of just enjoying there night . Eventually I was carried to another friends house were I video taped lying on a couch . I said some pretty stupid stuff that night I just kinda feel like a total dumb ass . The worst part about the whole thing was not being able to tell people about what happened because i could n't remember . I also have this one friend who really really loves to talk and tell stories , he also likes to kinda bs a bit with his stories , so anyways , this friend went a told bunch of people about it and yeah , I 'm sure it was n't as bad as he said it was , but I just could n't remember , and so I could n't tell him he was wrong or it was n't as bad as he was saying . Now the point of my story is that when you go out to drink or toke or whatever your into , do n't get so retarded that you ca n't tell people about what happened . Pace yourself with your drinking and do n't try and show off by drinking a lot , its not a competition , and your there to have fun , and trust me , hangovers suck the big one , so drink responsibly . Also , never get drunk around people who are not drinking , its always good to have a sober person to help out if things get too bad but you can make them feel uncomfortable or bored . So back to my story , ever since that night drinking I have n't gotten drunk , I 've gotten buzzed but never drunk , and I think I 'm almost afraid of getting drunk again . Which really sucks cause if your `` good '' drunk then its a blast . Anyways , enjoy your booze but be responsible . Cheers , Mick
