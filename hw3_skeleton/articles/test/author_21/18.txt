Now , I have pretty much no experience with weed , but I 'm still gon na tell you about my limited experiences . Very wordy opener eh . Anyways , first off , my personal experience with weed if very limited . I 've smoked up twice , but I have n't got stoned , I do n't think I 've even felt anything . So I was kind of dissapointed because I had heard it was really great . The only thing i felt was terrible breathe and like there was a mini fire in my throat . So from my experience weed kinda sucks , but I 'm gon na gon na stick with it until I actually get stoned , then I can decide whether or not its good . Because I have n't written very much I 'm gon na tell you about my friends experiences with weed through my eyes . Anyways , from what I can see , weed makes you tired , grouchy , relaxed , focused , very very not focused , cute , funny , extremly not funny but still think your funny , embarassed , shy , outgoing , and many other things . So pretty much weed can make you feel anything and it really varies from person to person . One friend of mine gets super relaxed and is really really cool to be around when stoned . Another gets grouchy and goes through periods of being really quiet and then gets really weird . And finally my girlfriend has acted different every time , the funny thing though is she acts the same after everytime . She gets really embarrassed even though I do n't care and I think she is fun to be around when stoned . O well , anyways , for those of you thinking bout weed , you pretty much never get stoned your first time , well I 've heard of a few people getting stoned their first time , but everyone else did n't get stoned . And your first time it hurts like hell and you cough like inhaled a pine cone . You also get super super bad breath with really does n't go away no matter how many pieces of gum you have . Also , for me , my second time I did n't get stoned either and I had quite a bit of weed , so I 'm pretty sure it takes at least a couple times before you will actually get stoned . Anyways , if you like getting drunk , stick with that , if you 're patient and you do n't mind stinky breath and coughing , try weed out if you want , its cheaper than beer . Cheers , Mick
