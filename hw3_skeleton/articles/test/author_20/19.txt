In a park far far away ... . from Toronto . ahem . excuse me . It 's the geek talking . No training between last Friday and this morning unfortunately . Real Life ( tm ) was taking up a good chunk of my time again . Early this morning , I had a session with my PT . The exercise today had to do with intervals . She wanted to watch my stride/gait as I was running so we hit a track not too far away from the Goodlife that I train at . Ran/walked/sprinted as much as I could over the next half hour . I probably should 've gotten more sleep the night before but I was busy with SJA . And I probably should 've eaten something but I did n't have anything appropriate in the fridge . At least I drank enuf water . : ) At any rate , my PT said that my stride/form looked good ( except for how I use my arms ) . Gave me a few pointers on how to use my arms to my advantage while sprinting ( loosen them up ) . So , it 's possible that it 's not how I 'm running that 's causing shin splints . And it does n't look like my shoes are a problem . So , ultimately , I still do n't know why I get shin splints every so often . Good thing I 've booked an appointment with a sports doctor . Hopefully he 'll be able to shed some light on the issue . The session today gives me hope that I 'll be able to do the half without any major problems . BTW , Bonky ... man you 're making me look like a lazy ass ... : )
