August 18 2004 Time : 6:30pm Place Running Room ( Outremont ) Group leader Dimitra On the menu : Interval Total mileage : 12km Weather low 20s humidity factor 5 on 10 How I felt before slightly tired but ready to run What I wore , Orange run tank , Nike shorts , wright sock and Nimbus V Jogged from Running Room west past OHS down cote sainte catherine to 1km loop Ran the 1km loop in line formation whereby everyone jogged and the last person in the line sprinted to the top the line . Then ran the 400m loop 1 slow 2 fast 2 slow 1 fast 1 slow 1 fast 1 slow Ran the first sprint too hard and paid for it dearly in the middle . Once I stopped for a break at the end of the drill one a guy ( Iron man ) and myself sprinted all the way back to the store . That felt great 2-3km sprint . Pretty wild considering I sprinted hard at the beginning , pretty much died in the middle In the end my quads were slightly stiff . Concerns : My hamstrings are becoming larger than my quads , I have to work the quads out .
