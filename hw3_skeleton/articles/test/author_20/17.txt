August 17 2004 Time : 5:30pm Place MAA gym led by Dorys Weather mid 20s humidity factor 6 on 10 How I felt prior . left shin/ankle flaring up sporadically . Path from Gym around the park up the trail to the start of the 1km loop On the menu : 4 seven minue pieces at 85 % effort ( speed that you would be able to maintain for a half hour run ) 3 minute rest inbetween each piece . First lap was completed at : 4:38 Second at 4:51 . Do n't remember 3rd . Final was at 4:50 There were segments of each lap which seemed reallly difficult and some segments that were too easy . The shin/ankle injury mitigated my speed work . I was last in the field to complete . How I felt afterward , Good and strong . The hard run allowed my body for find its natural rhythm . Concern : If only it did n't take an half hour of hard running to get me warmed up .
