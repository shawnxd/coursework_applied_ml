August 14 2004 Time 10am Weather 20 degrees Humdit factor 4/10 Path , MAA to Lafontaine 2 loops and back How I felt before : Slightly tired from Thursday 's practice Distance : 12km What I ate before , yogurt banana Pace : brutal Fatigue and an unknown pain from my originating from my left ankle relegated what was to be an easy run into a tough effort . Not wanting to aggravate this pain , for Sunday 's long run I ran slowly and could not for the duration of the outing find my rhythm and regular pace . Breathing was irregular and heart rate shot up fast despite the slow speed . Time to completion 1.5 hours . Rest break every 10min breaks became progessively longer as the session progressed . Running faster to establish a rhythm did not help as fatigue overwhelmed me . Barely stretched , hit the shower and went home . Was famished and extremely tired .
