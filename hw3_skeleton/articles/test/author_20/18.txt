Sunday August 14 2004 Time 7:30am Place : Running Room in Outremont Weather 13 degrees humidity factor 3 on 10 at the end : mid 20s humidity factor 5 on 10 How I felt before : Pain in left ankle was still present . What I ate : Banana and yogust What I was wearing Insight Run tank , Nike run shorts and Asic Nimbus V Distance 29km Path : Store down to old port West waterfountain on the path toward Lachine Canal cross bridge and return . Cut through Atwater market up to Sherbrooke down to Parc and stopped at the Statue at Mont Royal park Pace 6min km no faster . Kept pace with the group . Practiced 10 and 1 . Easy pace I was talking with the other runners . It 's funny I 'm looked at like a veteran runner by older people and the run leaders themselves . Time run 3:30 . Actual time elasped 4:30 ( approx ) At the start my ankle was still stiff so I did was not sure if I was going to run this distance . The stiffness was manageable as I did not push the pace . Ran with 2 new people who never ran more than 10km . The both dropped out and took metro home . One at the 20km mark and the other at the 25km mark I actually convinced a guy how important pacing was . Once he witnessed the other 2 runners drop out He thanked me for pacing him . He is used to running faster but by conserving energy early it enabled him to successfully complete with the temperature became hotter and more humid . I wanted to run faster but I did not early for fear of injury and could not later as the heat drained me . Concerns : 10 and 1 approach drains so much energy in the later stages . What will I do on race day . Stopped at the park and walked back . As I was walked , the legs were becoming increasingly stiff with each step I was really hungry at the 25km mark . What strategy should I follow for the race on the big day ?
