Yay for random ! I was just reading some of y-alls blogs and felt inspired . Firstly : Blogs are so nice because you can write your honest opinion and be spared the trouble of someone 's immediate reactions . You only run into trouble when s-one who should not have read your blog , reads it ... . ( not to name any names ) . But about opinions , its great that people can feel spiritually inspired about taking leadership and not goofing off , but in all honesty was it really worth all the time to write it out , or is some action REALLY gon na be taken ' ? Just a little encouragement to follow through with your words . : ) Secondly : I love books ! I know some of y'all do n't appreciate them as much as me , but fiction rules ! It 's so nice , when life sucks , and problems flood you , to distract yourself by stepping into another place , or another point in time ( that is-after you 've made things right with God ) . I recently finnish reading A THORN IN MY HEART , which is a WONDERFUL story , taken from the one of Jacob and Essau , and Rachel and Leah , but in Scottland and in a different year . I think I told lots of you about it , or else you asked me why I was bawling my eyes out in school ... : ) . It took a whole different perspective on that story , and I found a lot more in common with 'Leah ' than I would have thought , and although fiction , this story encouraged me to stay close to God , even when he answers `` no '' to your prayer requests . I love ya all , and C-ya 2morrow !
