Im here in Peru and I finally found a computer ! Yay ! I Miss you all soooooo much ! Im in Lima and just spent a week in Cuzco . Its so cold ! ! ! I really miss summer ! But it is like Indiana in the sense that its really humid in Lima and the hair is a frizz ball ! Well cuzco was really pretty and Ill have to show you all the pictures cuz i really cant describe . Ive been to Macchu Picchu and all sorts of other Incan ruins around cuzco . Also went to lake Titicaca ( think WAY back to geography class ) and visited the floating reed islands etc . . Today we visited the main plaza of Lima : including cathedrals and the museum of the inquisition . Its kinda depressing really how catholic south america was and is . I mean there are catherdrals everywhere and they are the nicest buildings in the city . I mean painting upon painting , statues , gold plated altars , candles-the works ! - how can you make a sinful mortal such as Mary to be a god . And how can you put God in a box and say that this crucifix is how he was and all that he was . that he came to die . Thats not the end of the story ! To worship a little idol and just by rich decorations and money and burning candles , you can somehow win God´s approval into heaven . And also how people would be tortured for not being exactly as the church wanted ! The food here is not as bad as i expected ! I havent had too much seafood ( yet ) , and IncaCola and Fanta keep me sane . That and the movies on tv that are in English with span . subtitles . no , peru is pretty cool but i still miss you all and cant wait to come back home ! ! ! ! luv y´all , turz
