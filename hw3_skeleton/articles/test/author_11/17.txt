... .back again ! ... Hey to all my friends who read this ( namely : Emily . You rock ! ) . I wanted to go to church last night to see y'all but the flight from Chicago to Indy got canceled , so that meant a four hour trip by limo down to Indy to pick up the van and return here to good 'ol Lafayette ! y'know : as great as summer is , sometimes I just hate it cuz its full ( for me ) of selfish discontentment . School ends , i do n't want it to . I go on vacation , I dont really want to , I come back , and I dont really want to . Dont get me wrong . I luv y'all , but only now do i realize what an awesome vacation it was and I miss it . ( that and the fact that I realize you all will leave 4 smite soon and I have to work in the freakin ' corn ! ) . Thankfully two weeks out of corn season will be spent in Indy at a ballet camp , which is really cool except I have n't taken a class since , oh the middle of may , and dancers are all expected to be skinny minnies and bendy wendys . So now I 'm gon na say farewell and get off my lazy bum and see what I can do about the extra vacation pounds ! : )
