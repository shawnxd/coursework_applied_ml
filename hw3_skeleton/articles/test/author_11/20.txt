Ever noticed how fast the summer goes ? School just let out and we 're starting again ! ! ! My best wishes go out to the SMITE teams down sweating in the Bahamas , or freezing in Peru-hope to see you all soon ! Not much is up now with me . I got back last night from spending two weeks in Indianapolis at a ballet camp . It was quite an experience , and more than I could ever write , in one blog . The first three days I thought I 'd never make it , but it was so much fun . Dancing 5 hours a day is a lot . Other than the standard technique and pointe classes there were ... Acting : my favorite class ! always humorous with lots of improvisation . Variations/repretoire : we learns variations from Don Quiote , and other ballets Modern : Greggory hancock taught us a really fun indian dance Partnering : Ha ! I 'm so bad at it ! Especially with a 6'5 '' professional Russian guy ! ( who wore WAY too much cologne ) we performed several dances on Friday night at a theatre in the University of Indy , in beautiful tutu 's and other fun costumes . Well , I 'll stop now before you are all bored , so have a great summer ( or what 's left of it ! )
