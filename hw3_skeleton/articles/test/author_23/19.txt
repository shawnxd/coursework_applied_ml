All these things to do , in such a short period of time . I doubt if I 'll get the energy to get anything done . The weather sure plays a big role in everything . Not only is it gloomy outside , but I get these massive headaches at the back of my head that a mandatory nap on the bed is in order . If not , I think I 'd die from the pain . Well not literally . Bah ... ... ..This is when I 'd really like to crawl into a ball and disappear , just until everything gets sorted out . So many things running through my head . Holy , I never knew I could store that much stuff up there . I need to do something fun , and soon . Well maybe this weekend will fulfill all of that . Being with friends is always fun . A road trip would be cool . Now if only I 'd get my G2 before the summer . But no , I 'm going to have to wait until October . The time is coming when soon I 'll be another year older . So much has happened in the sixteenth year of my life . I 've learned so much . I went through a lot . It surely has been the best year of my life so far . When I come to think of it , I am real young . I have n't lived half of my life yet . I 'm really excited to get older and see what more knowledge I can acquire . Well as for now , I 'm going to go with the flow . And try to not lose my temper , be positive , and smile . Got to keep a damn smile on my face . Why ? At least I 'll make others feel happy . But that 's going to be be tough . But I can do it ! Hehehe : ) Tootles ... ..Until I write again ... ... ... .ela
