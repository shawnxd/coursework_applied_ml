I had the best nap ever ! As I lay in my bed the sun shone threw my window and warmed me up . I soon found myself in deep sleep , and had no worries at all . Not having a certain time to wake up or anything . Then Waking up after a few hours , feeling more awake than ever . And I sit here now , in front of my computer slowly coming back into reality , and still in my pajamas . Today has been a very tiring day . Not that I did so much today , just the fact that every little thing tired me out . And some people noticed and knew to stay away from me and give me some space . I was also very emotional . I found myself during science class tear eyed for no reason at all . Possibly because of everything right now is overwhelming me , maybe . But I really appreciate those friends who you know can always be there to joke things up . They do n't do it on purpose . They 're just naturally funny . And that 's the best you can get . A few jokes before heading home , made my trip home more lively . This is one thing I hate . When you know that someone wants to talk to you , but they made a promise to themselves that they will wait until you speak up first , but clearly , when you do talk to them they hardly seem interested to talk to you . But you know that they 're just trying to be the better person and stick to what they say , when the truth is , that the better person would just confront the other person and talk things through . Well , i just needed to get that out . And i feel much better . I 'm finished writing for now . if more comes to mind , you 'll be the first to know . Tootles -ela
