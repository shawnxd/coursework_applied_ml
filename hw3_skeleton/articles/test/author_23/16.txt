So I have n't written in here for a few days now , I could n't find the time . We 'll start with Friday : Garbage picking day . It was fun . Well except for the whole picking up garbage part . Nah . It was good . Found a lot of interesting stuff . Tires , clothes , etc . And Trojan did win against Durex . Hahaha . My body hurt so much from picking up all that stuff then walking to and from church . Yup , it just was a fun filled day . Saturday : Started off by walking to school for the cheerleading competition . We got 2nd place , which is really good . Came home . Got all ready for Lukes party . Went to Lukes party . And well what can I say . Maybe I can put into words everything that I want to say later . I ca n't seem to find the words right this instant . Sunday : Came home at 2:30 am . Woke up at 6:50 am . Went to church nice and early . Came home and watched TV until 1pm . I just finished watching an old movie on TV . It 's called `` Three came home '' . A very , very good movie . I 'm fond of old , black and white films . And this was exactly just it . About how the Japanese took over . A ladies story of the whole thing . The rough times they had to go through . Trying to keep herself and her little boy alive . Then at the end Finally being able to see her husband after many years , and thinking this whole time that he was dead . So emotional . I usually can hold it in . But this time I just bawled . Could n't hold it in . I do n't like being so emotional . People assume you are weak , and fragile . While I 'd rather be strong and tough . Well , I 'll write more later . Tootles -Ela
