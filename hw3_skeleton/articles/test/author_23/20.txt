That fresh smell of falling rain . The sound it makes on the rooftops . Man I love the feeling that comes along with it . It makes me just want to curl up and sleep . Well , I do need my sleep . And being tired is more common to me . I do n't know why . I do n't have an explanation for the way I 've been feeling for the past few days . > Now back to what I was talking about . I 'm not stressed out , I 'm not going into depression . Am I talking crazy here . I 've been thinking a lot . But it does n't seem a lot . I do n't know how to make sense of it all . I need a vacation to get away from this all for a while . Meet new people . Experience new things . That 's what I strive for . Yet , my shyness always interferes . I can never get the courage to do things I 'd love to do . Maybe one day that 'll all change . It 's thundering right now . I hate thunder . Makes me feel all helpless inside . Wo n't it just go away . That 's one of my fears . I also hate the dark . I ca n't see anything , and that scares me . Wow this thunder is loud . Make it stop ! Sorry just getting a little paranoid right now . You know being home alone and all . Not knowing where my father is at the moment . Loneliness is filling up my house along with me inside . But that 's what MSN is for . To talk to friends and hope they 'll be there by your side . Well , now that it 's raining there goes the whole rollerblading with scouts idea . Seems like it was never meant to be . Well , what more can I write . It seems that every guy I like either likes someone else , or just is n't interested , And most guys that like me , I just do n't feel anything there . Or , maybe I 'm just scared to feel . I 'm not to sure . But I 've learned not to dwell too much in that area , for it only takes away for all the happy times I could be missing out on . If there really are happy times in between , I 'm not sure . But that 's what people have been telling me . Well , I might write some more later on tonight . After scouts . Maybe something interesting will happen . Tootles -ela : )
