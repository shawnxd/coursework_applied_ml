Well , it sure had been a crazy filled day . I 've lived it to the max . And not even a sec . Was I bored . It started off with waking up after like the longest sleep ever , and I was SO tired . It was crazy . Then came school . Fire drill . Lunch outside in the nice sunshine . Then lounging around in fashion class . And then came THE LAST DAY OF CHEERLEADING PRACTICE . O man . I have n't worked my butt off that much in so long . Even though I dreaded coming to practice that day , it sure was not that bad . But my mind is made up , I 'm not going to change my decision . Well at the end of practice our couch is like there 's a dinner thing tonight at 6 . We want like the 5 of you to come . So we said sure . I got home at 5:30 , dressed up nicely , got to the hall around 6:15 . And what a fun night it was . So many jokes ... ..Well there are always a lot of jokes . First on the drive there these construction guys tried to pick us up in our car . Ewwwwwwwwww . They were old . Then at the hall an old guy wanted yola to buy him a drink . And he kept stalking her . It was a dinner for all these athletes in mississauga . It was cool . Free food . That 's all I can say . And here I am . At 11:38 pm . Having a bunch of stuff due tomorrow . I do n't think I 'll ever finish . And then I got to shower . Bah ! hahahaha . All I can do is laugh , because I 'm so tired and I do n't think I can stay awake any longer . I have n't had time to think at all today . So now is my thinking time before I go to bed . Because if I do n't think now , I 'll go to bed and I wo n't fall asleep because I 'll be thinking too much . So first of all , I have to remember to live my life for me . I have to plan things out and not worry if someone else is doing something that same day and I might want to go there , even if it 's not for sure . Because if I 'll do that I 'll end up staying home doing nothing . So I need to plan things according to me . You may not understand , but I do n't know how to explain , it 's all clear up in my head , but when it comes to typing it out , yeah , not so good at that . Okej , I need to get other stuff done , so I 'm done writing for tonight . tootles -ela
