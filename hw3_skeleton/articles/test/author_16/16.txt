As you may or may not know I am reading a biography of Jack Kerouac whose title I can not remember . The reason for this is that when I read books or listen to songs I am unconcerned with their names . I think people who make it a point to memorize the name of author and title of the book they are reading are doing so only to brag about it later on . `` I 'm reading such and such by so and so muah muah muah '' with their big fat cigar and bowtie god I hate these people . The only time I remember who the book is written by or what the book is called is if it is so good that I have to recommend it by everyone I know or meet . Otherwise the author remains a stranger and rightly so . But Eve , they say , But Eve , that 's like bringing a stranger to bed every night . I say fuck that . An author whose name I have no reason to remember is not a stranger , she 's just a snack , something to tide me over until the author of my dreams comes around . Anyway . I am reading this biography of Jack Kerouac and I learned something really wild about him last night , that many of you probably already know but still ... It blew my mind so maybe it will blow yours too : Jack 's mom , a French Canadian woman he called Memere ( how cute is that ? ) tried to seduce him when he was in his thirties . His mom . What blows me away about that is that she tried to do it when he was a grown man . By the time you are 30 you know that you should not be fucking your mother . You will have attended at least one Introduction to Psychology class , and even the biggest recluse on the planet has heard about Freud and Oedipus so there is no excuse . But the biggest shit in the bowl ladies and gentlemen , what really freaks me out , is that Memere must have been around 50 by this point . After 50 years in our society , she knew that what she was doing was wrong , and yet she got the nerve to do it anyway . The nerve ! You could cut glass with nerve like that ! Imagine the risk . Imagine wanting to fuck your son so bad that you are brought to the point of propositioning him . Imagine facing the look of disgust on his face , and saying fuck it , I 'll do it anyway because I 'd rather regret something I did than something I did n't do . Wow . *** I told Pete and Lisa about it over lunch today and Pete kind of chuckled . I asked him why and he said that we live in a funny world , that had the roles been reversed and a father propositioned his daughter , the mood of our conversation would be completely different . `` You would be saying , what a fucking asshole to do such a thing rather than , I wonder what was wrong with her that she wanted to fuck her son . '' I did n't respond then because he had a point and I did n't want to address it without thinking about it first . So I walked away from the restaurant thinking about sexual mores and how the same intention or idea coming from different sexes can have such radically different associations . And I thought : Pete , the reason why we react differently is because we know that if a man really wants to fuck a woman , he can . All he has to do is get a decent hard on and force her . Sadly , when we as a society think of a man 's sexual need , we think of the violence that can be associated with it . However , when a woman wants a man , be it her son or a stranger or whatever , there is no way she can force it on him . The only thing she can do is manipulate him emotionally or psychologically , and even that allows the man to make a choice . In other words , the difference between a man 's need and a woman 's need for sex is that a woman relies on a consenting partner and a man does not . So Pete , until men stop ramming their cocks into people who do n't want their holes plugged , we will always equate male sexuality with violence , even if only on the subliminal level .
