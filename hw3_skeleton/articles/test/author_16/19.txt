So people at work keep on asking how my vacation was . I ca n't tell them what I really did ( D is for debauchery , kids ) so I am forced to say , `` Not much '' and leave it at that . They always look so disappointed . *** I have the worst luck in the world too . Halfway through my vacation I got the flu or something , and it was raining all the time so I just sort of hung out and read poetry and watched a hell of a lot of TV . Hard to be debaucherous when you 're leaking from all ends and hanging out on the couch all day . Shit after a week of that I found myself worrying about terrorist attacks ( too much CNN I guess ) and craving Kraft Dinner . I have n't had Kraft Dinner in years . Do n't know , maybe I developed standards ? *** I hate CNN . I think Wolf Blitzer is the human equivalent of a textbook that 's been hanging out in puddles all day . And what kind of name is Wolf Blitzer anyway ? It 's like he tried to get into porn and then could n't make with the wood come audition time and thought to himself , well , there 's always the news ... *** What I hate most about CNN is that Americans trust it . They believe what Wolf is telling them . They do n't question it . *** I also hate people who watch Dr. Phil . I want to scream Hey arseholes , use that hour of your life to get off your fat , donut eating , kraft dinner making , beige sweatpant wearing lard asses and get on a treadmill . Because I know for a fact that everyone who watches Dr. Phil religiously is either fat , was fat or is going to be fat . They all act as if he is a god or something . He 's robbing five hours from their lives a week ! Hours they will never get back ! If I believed that they spent as much or more than 5 hours a week working on their own issues , I would n't hate the idea of softcore psychiatry so much . But they do n't ! They listen to him yak for an hour , they listen to the slutty bad girls , the uncommunicative fat husbands , the depressed mothers , they nod their fat , wobbly heads and go `` Yeah , that Dr. Phil , he 's so smart . '' and then they 're screaming at their kids to shut the fuck up with that music , or go out and play in traffic or whatever . It makes me sick . Once I was talking to this old friend of mine and she was telling me that she gets into this really deep conversations with her brother during the commercial breaks but when Dr. Phil comes back on she 's like punching him in the arm to shut the fuck up . Her own brother is getting punched in the arm so this girl can hear Dr. Phil drawl about how crack cocaine kills babies . I doubt Dr. Phil would condone that . Shit tell these assholes to spend 5 hours a week reading instead who knows what could happen . I doubt CNN would be so popular .
