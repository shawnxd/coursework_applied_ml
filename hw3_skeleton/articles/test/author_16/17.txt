I skipped work today and went to the St. Sauveur water slides . My arms and shoulders are this angry crimson color now from spending more than 10 minutes in the sun . I had a pretty good time , except for the fact that in the seven hours I was there I only got to go on like 5 rides . The lines were atrocious . I wanted to ask these people if they had jobs but I could tell my the tans that they did not . You can tell the people who skipped work to be there by their serious lack of color . *** There is something really weird about waiting in line half naked and slightly damp . *** I got to speak to one of my ex boyfriends for a while . He and I dated in grade eleven and even lost our virginity to one another . He was really sweet . I dumped him after a year because of many reasons , the biggest one being that I wanted to do more than hang out in his room giving him blowjobs and watching bad sitcoms on his 13 inch tv . Anyway . We got to talk for the first time in years and it was nice . So much time has passed since those days of hanging out in his room , so many things changed , we 're not even the same people anymore . I 'm not nearly as sweet , I can tell you that much . I know I 'm not a sweet person because when I meet girls that are really nice , I realize how not nice I am . Kind of like gauging a tan based on how pale the rest of your skin is . I admire girls who can be really friendly and nice and sweet . *** Shane ( that 's his name ) is a very nice guy and totally hot . I have had crushes on him since we broke up so many years ago , but have never done anything about it because I think I really hurt him when we broke up , even though we were both kids really . He is totally against one night stands , and wants to meet his soul mate . Shane , best of luck to you my friend . I hope you have a soul mate , and furthermore , I hope you find her . *** It makes me wonder if soul mates exist and if we know them when we find them . I wonder who mine is . Is he fabulous like me ? Of course he is . He would have to be .
