Awesome time ... ..party with barbeque ( Canada size ... can I make it ? ) , fireworks at Kinsmen ( hitting children/dogs with a soccer ball , but obviously , `` not really '' ) , hilarious friends , which obviously preceded the immense amount of laughter and on it goes . The not-really-but-kinda highlight : meeting random people who read my blog , because it 's connected to Dan 's ? ... Hi Todd and Phil , whatever happened to YOUR sites ? there 's no link ... not to mention props and all other things related to cool kids . And the hours of amusement from the ring tones . In Da Club . and I have n't blogged for forever . Cuz I was at my cottage for a while and then just never got around to it really ... busy doing not much of anything . It looks like the search for a job will be hopeless . Everyone I 've talked ( that 's looking ) has n't found one , and everyone I 've talked to that has one says there are n't any ... like we just ran out of jobs ? We 'll see . All the more time to work on my portfolio , ( oil painting ? haha ) so I can apply to OCAD and make my own clothes , as the story goes . Tomorrow I 'm going to cancel my G2 test ( it 's `` on '' Monday ) and reschedule for a later date ... I 'm setting myself up to fail , I really think I will at this rate . But I 'm going for a special lesson from YD tomorrow . Whoop dee doo ! ( that was meant sincerely , i love driving . haha ) So , about that portfolio ... anyone have juice ? Creative juice that is ! I have some ideas floating around , but I need to catch them and then represent them , with mediums . Ah , I need to get some sleep , too much energy . Actually , I 'm hungry . I want to change my blog colours ... everything is so complicated ! Haha !
