That 's right ! Sitting here playing on the computer of the Director of the Durham District of Young Driver 's of Canada ( he 's late and the nice office ladies let me use it ) . And when he gets here , I am having a driving lesson ... to refresh my once excellent driving skills ! Yay ! The office ladies are so cute , they just asked if I wanted a cup of tea ! They are all so sweet . Well , back to playing on the director 's computer ! Haha .
