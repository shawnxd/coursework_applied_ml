post . post-adventure . the opposite of pre . and that 's all there is to it . stuck here in this endless web of suburbian ideals . ca n't we break out ? it 's already been done , but unfortunately not being done . when do i get to go back ... the meeting of the NGC CEOs need to commence ASAP . and then some . sleep evades time and it all keeps passing . the drone of summer , the last of 17. all i can remember is the trip to the conbini . the surreal and ethereal mist of that one long moment that lasted 17 minutes and then i was back inside . who else was outside then ? no one important . and as it fades it grows stonger , more intense . one person , and all rules broken . laughter cuts the silence , shatters it , and the pieces are dissolved . koko , watashi dake wa nihongo wakaru . nihongo dake jinai , nihon . sono koto wa jibun no desu , mada aru . all i want to do is speak swedish . he has been left behind , to be met on the road ahead . he told me so . He will never leave me , nor forsake me .
