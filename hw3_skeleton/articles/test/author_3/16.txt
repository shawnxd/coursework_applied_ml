What an excellent weekend ! As summer goes by , somewhat non-thrillingly , there are the times when you just need times of good times . This was one of those times . Driving a snazzy car , having some pretty great conversations , meeting some new people , being at the cottage , boating , tubing , laughing like mad with my sister , watching the stars , watching the lake , thinking , being with parts of my extended family , cruising back in the same snazzy car . And my birthday is coming up ... less than a month ! The big 1-8 , which is n't all that big , but I 'd like to point out that I 'm now 5'7 '' ( 170 cm ) which makes me happy . Also , I 'm going to be a bridesmaid ! Other random news : Wow , I suppose it seems all I can talk about is Japan , Japan , Japan ... but after having Japan be my life for so long , it 's strange to have that part cut out . However , I will be returning soon ( a couple years ? ) . Anyways , what I think is strange is how much I was looking forward to seeing all my friends when I got back to Canada , but how little I 've seen any of them . I mean , I 've said 'hi ' to a bunch of people , but not really 'hung out ' ( for lack of a better term ) or talked to them . This is a little saddening , because most of them are moving away this August/September and time is fleeting . So , hopefully I 'll call some of you up soon , and we 'll do something . Actually , maybe I 'll have a party ... Lastly , I must say I must do some art for my portfolio . I keep having all these great ideas , as I fall asleep ! I should start experimenting with some of them . After all these personality/intelligence strengths/what-have-you tests we did in various TAG and Careers class , I realize I do alot of plan and not much 'doing ' . But tomorrow I will do . Good night .
