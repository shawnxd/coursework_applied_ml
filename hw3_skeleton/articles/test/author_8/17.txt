Dr.Mary Zemansky spoke to the support group in Valparaiso on Wednesday evening . It was wonderful to have such a knowledgeable speaker join us . She spoke on Cognitive Rehabilitation . This is extremely important for not only those who have suffered a traumatic brain injury , but also those who are aging or whose medications have caused some cognitive dulling . You can teach an old brain new tricks or at least make it better able to recall the ones you have already taught it . Dr.Zemansky spoke about retraining attention which consists of four basic steps . Orientation - remembering simple things like your name , age , date . Selective attention - blocking out stimuli Alternating attention - multitasking Divided attention - doing 2 or more things at once . This is the one that your brain has to train the most for . Rote Practice is the best way to accomplish these things . That is what we learned in third grade ... repeat and review until you have it down . Your brain has to practice to get better at remembering . Keeping your brain active is the best training . Reading , word searches , crossword puzzles , and games are all great for keeping your brain healthy . The older we get the longer it will take to learn things and sometimes to remember them , but practice and patience will prevail .
