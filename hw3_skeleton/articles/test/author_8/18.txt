The next meeting of the DBSA of Northwest Indiana will be a speaker meeting . Dr. Mary Zemansky will be joining us to discuss how to better organize the compartments of the brain . It should be a beneficial discussion for anyone that needs a little more memory and a better functioning brain . I ca n't imagine anyone who could n't benefit from that . Dr.Zemansky is in practice with Dr. Robert Walsh in Chesterton at Comprehensive Psychology Services , PC . She also lectures at Ivy Tech . It will be an informative and educational discussion and I hope you will join us . If you are unable to attend you will find a summary of the lecture on DBSA blogspot the next day . Please do n't forget to join us for the lively discussion group for Teens and Young Adults on the second and fourth Tuesday 's of the month . Encourage the young people in your life to join us , even if they do n't suffer from depression or bipolar disorder , it is a chance to get together with others and talk about what is important to them . I would be remiss if I also did n't remind you to join the group in Merrillville on July 12 and 26 for their regular discussion meetings . Keep and eye on this site for an interesting article about people who are addicted to suicide . It is in the works and should be here in the next few days . See you at a meeting .
