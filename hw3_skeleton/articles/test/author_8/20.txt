It may seem hard to believe and for some it is very difficult to discuss . It is however true . There seems to be a new mental health phenomenon . Suicide for the overwhelming thrill it can give to take life to the edge of death and live to tell about it . Many leave behind loved ones to tell their story and struggle to understand the obsession . It is mostly young women who are suffering from this `` addiction to suicide '' . Most of these young woman suffer from depression , bipolar disorder or some other form of a mood disorder . Some are just attention seeking in the most desperate way possible . Like cutting , which has reached epic proportions among young women , suicide is a way to ease the pain that life often brings . For the parents who may not be familiar with the term `` cutting , '' it is when a person inflects pain on themselves by cutting into their skin with almost anything you can think of . It can also be burning oneself with a cigarette or other ways of torture , that we ca n't even imagine . Teens tell me that `` cutting '' relieves their pain or enables them to feel pain . It also puts them in control of the pain they feel . Most say they do it in private and are careful to mark places others wo n't see . The attention seekers often cut where you can see and want you to take notice . Unlike males that often seek far more successful means of suicide such as guns , knives , and hanging , these females often choose less drastic forms of suicide . It is not that they are not serious , but that the thrill is getting as close as they can without crossing that limit . Taking just enough pills and then calling 911 for help . Remembering at the last second that they promised to call their therapist before attempting suicide again and making that call . Some do succeed and then the thrill ends their life . It is a very high price to pay for the rush of death . This is a day and age where everything is `` now '' and `` want . '' We no longer need things or wait for them . Death is no different . These young people have tried all the risk taking they can think of . The thrill is just no longer achievable . There are n't any more cries for attention that have not been tried , heard , and ignored . Now there is only the rush of suicide . We ca n't ignore this desire to die because often they do succeed . We should never , not take a suicide threat seriously because you only get one chance to make a mistake . The price you pay is the life of someone you love . If you know someone who mentions suicide as a thought they have entertained , talk about it and help them to get the professional help they need . It may be an uncomfortable conversation . Discussing it does not make it more likely to happen , but not talking about it can .
