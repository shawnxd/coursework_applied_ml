Last night I was n't sure how the topic of the support group meeting would apply to me . Tom Isakson was with us and the topic was `` Homeless in Porter County . '' How could I really relate to the homeless situation ? I donate money to shelters , I pass on clothing and hygiene products . I have empathy for the homeless , but when I see a person with a cardboard sign asking for my money while they smoke a cigarette all I really feel is disgusted . Why do n't they get a job ? They are in front of McDonald 's whose `` help wanted '' sign is clearly visible . I almost did n't attend this meeting and that would have been a tragedy because Tom Isakson opened my eyes to a side of homelessness that I had not seen . It was an enlightening experience . I learned that the fastest growing population of homelessness in our area are families . Approximately 300 children in our area go to bed each night not knowing where they will sleep tomorrow or the next night . 150 of these children are under the age of six . There are about 750 people without a home in Porter County each year . This number continues to grow . There are three basic types of homelessness . The first being Chronic Homelessness . These people are often homeless for a long time . These are the people we typically think of when we hear the word `` homeless . '' They often dress in rags , eat from dumpsters , and live in squalor . There are four primary reasons that we , as a group , were able to list for chronic homelessness . 1 . Chronic Sever Mental Illness . Without medication these people are unable to get help . 2 . Substance Abuse/Gambling Addiction . Gov't cuts have made it more difficult for these people to get the help they need to recover . 3 . Duel Diagnosis . Both Sever Mental illness and substance addiction . 4 . Post traumatic Stress Disorder . These people have suffered such trauma that they are unable to deal with life . They have no hope and no will to live . They could be war veterans , domestic violence victims , suffered the tragic death of a loved one or a child , or the collapse of their business . I ca n't help but wonder if this population will grow as soldiers return from Iraq as it did when our forces returned from Vietnam . Next we have One Time Homelessness . People often bounce back from this type of homelessness . The causes for one time homelessness could effect any of us . 1 . Fire 2 . Divorce 3 . Domestic violence/trauma 4 . Natural disasters 5 . Joblessness . People living paycheck to paycheck without savings . I remember seeing a TV program once that said `` we are all three paychecks away from being homeless . '' With that in mind , this could be any of us . Last we have Episodic Homelessness . This is the largest growing category and the one that includes the most children . 1 . Living from friend to friend , never knowing where the next bed will be . 2 . May get ahead for a while and then slip , never really attaining stability . A . Bad luck B . Chronic illness . Off and on physical , mental , or medical disability that effects their work ability . C. Low wages . At $ 5.15 an hour you need work a 107 hour week to afford the average apartment . D. Single parenting/unpaid child support . The district attorney 's office just ca n't keep up . E. Life skills deficits . Usually money management issues are the biggest problem . a. Impulsive spending . Often the result of illness such as bipolar disorder . b . Emotional control/poor anger management . Not able to control their anger and keep a job or getting in trouble with the law for fighting . c. Poor impulse control . Calling in sick because they feel like it or not showing up on time . d . Poor or low education . No post graduate education or trade school . No job training . e. Dysfunctional families . Most adults that go through the shelter had dysfunctional families . These people lived with abusive , alcoholic , or non-existent parents . The most important job of a parent is to teach a child that they are loved . This does n't cost anything and anyone can do it . We could all work toward ending the dysfunctional family in America by simply teaching love . The second thing we can all do is promise to be the very best friend to our friends that we can be . Ask what we can do to help in a time of loss or crisis . Do n't desert them when the worst appears to be over . Hang in there and be a friend for the long haul . Tom has some definite thoughts about what America needs to do to help stop homelessness . Raising the minimum wage to make it a wage that people could actually live on . Employers need to stop hiring part-time workers that they do n't have to pay benefits to . Welfare is the only gov't fund that has not seen a cost of living increase since 1985 . More and more jobs are done by robots and computers or outsourced . Homelessness is increasing by 5 % a year in Porter County alone . The Spring Valley Shelter ( a shelter for families ) is only able to provide shelter to about 12 % of those who ask for help due to their small size . The only other gov't owned housing in Porter County is the Hospital and the County Jail . Christian Community Action is trying to raise $ 1,750,000.00 to build and support a bigger shelter . This campaign is called `` Raise A Roof . '' If you can help with a tax deductible contribution please contact the CCA at urlLink ccaopc @ netnitco.net or by phone at 219-548-2379 .
