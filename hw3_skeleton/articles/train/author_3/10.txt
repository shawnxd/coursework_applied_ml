that 's what she said , but in english `` a bird pooed on me [ my head ] '' . some people just make me laugh ... charity ... these are the reasons it 's great to be back . not to mention seeing a strange `` lion '' today . why do all `` lions '' have manes ? that seems to be a cross-continental pattern . long beach . utsunomiya . ajax . everywhere . AND , Charity was ever so helpful in brainstorming how I could graduate from high school , either this year or next . a ) get Japanese credits transferred , take ENG 12 during summer school . commence . b ) get Japanese credits transferred , take one semester of next year . work . c ) get Japanese credits transferred , take one semester of next year . enter unversity during the winter semester . d ) get Japanese credits transferred , take ENG 12 during summer school . commence . do the rest of Grade 12 next year . I think I 'll do some stirring and get Japanese credits transferred , perhaps take English in summer school , and then do at least one full semester of grade 12 and then the second semester as half days only , so I can work in the afternoons ( the root of that being that university equals dollars ) . We 'll see what guidance has to say about any of this . Tomorrow .
