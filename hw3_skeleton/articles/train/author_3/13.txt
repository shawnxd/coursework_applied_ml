almost best friends , but the farthest possibility . itsumo waratta . itsumo . and now , we never laugh because we ca n't . i wish time was n't , but since it is , i deal with what it brings . what is the most taisetsu ? nani ga ichiban important ? kangae ni , i know it does n't matter , time will cause me to forget , or at least disattach myself . sukoshi zutsu , mainichi mo chotto . the more experience , the more complicated . but i 'd rather have something to think about than nothing to know . mada warau yo , i am still laughing ; we 'll meet again .
