I just watched a program on CBC called `` Screw the Vote '' ... some random guy who went all over Canada to ask 18-34 year olds why they do n't vote . The number one reason being that `` our votes do n't count '' . ( Note : by saying 'our ' I mean 'their ' because I wo n't be 18 till August ... unfortunately ) . So , they had some interesting things to say . One girl/lady from Montreal ( an artsy type ) said if she was American she would vote , just because she 'd either really like or really hate Bush . She would have a reason to vote . The American President , regardless of your personal opinion of him , causes a reaction in most people , thus creating the desire to either support or not , vote or vote for someone else . Canada 's PM is n't known for being especially charismatic or anything , just kinda a middle-of-the-road guy . If he was someone who caused reaction in people , ( ex . Pierre Trudeau ) , he/they would have more younger people voting . to omou ( I think ) . That is one of my opinions on this , not that I can affect anything until August , after the election . This makes me want to run for something , just to try to change the system . Maybe one day I will , after I become legal age ...
