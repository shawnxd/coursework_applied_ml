A year late . I guess you 're right , Dan , in saying a year late related to what . There is no late , as long as there is no comparison , and I guess I 'm actually graduating `` on time '' but just a different time . Sweet . If I had n't gone to Japan I would be missing alot of experiences . Not to mention that 's where I decided what I want to `` pursue '' after graduation . ARt . I 'm so excited for life right now . Life in general . This summer will be sweet , next year doing grade 12 with sweet classes , and I 'm so hyped for applying to university , and hopefully being accepted at the one I want to get into . And excited for going back to Japan , hopefully in 2 years . And excited for getting a job . Excited about being back with [ Canadian ] friends . My family , excited to see my brother on Monday ( getting back from Scotland ) . Excited . But why this excitement ? Why is everything so peachy keen ? I will tell you . It 's because I 'm excited about God . He 's the One who has given me so much peace about my future goals ( art ... ) . He 's the One who has given my life purpose , and a purpose I 'm excited about . Like a cycle . Everytime I hear a worship song , I am just excited because I know He has a purpose for me , my time here on earth . And I 'm so excited to be back having good times , good conversations , with my Christian friends . Encouraging each other , questioning , praying for each other , laughing ; this is what I missed in Japan . This is a real life . And I know it 's just begun . watashi wa mada juunana sai desu , kore made wa hajime dake . kore kara wa tanoshimi desu yo .
