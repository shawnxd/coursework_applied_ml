This was the first year I 've ever picked courses and not had a conflict . I appreciate that . So , the verdict is ... no commencement . Until 2005 , that is . I ca n't take English during summer school cuz I have my G2 test on the first day of the classes , and I ca n't transfer Japanese credits as easily as once thought . Apparently , if you go on an exchange out of `` free will '' ( as opposed to being `` forced '' ? ) your credits do n't count for much , unless you have some sort of test score or other internationally recognized official document saying that you can speak another language . So , luckily , I was n't counting on those credits to graduate , and it looks like I 'll just have to paste my picture to the wall beside all your graduating photos , and have my real photo a year later . Oh well . But the happy news , is that I love my classes next year . I love school ... Sememster I : -Drawing/Painting -Writer 's Craft ( online ) -World History -Biology Semester II : -Weight Training -English -Visual Art -Chemistry And all I have to do is actually hand in my 40 hours and I get my diploma . And a Gifted Certificate . And then I commence . A year late .
