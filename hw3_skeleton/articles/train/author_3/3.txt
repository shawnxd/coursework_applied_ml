is the day on which I will finally see my brother ! Who I have n't seen in a year , might I add . Yaaay , except he 's only home for 5 days before he leaves for his summer courses . He leaves on the 6th day . I knew it last year , but it did n't seem for real till this year . My `` full family '' life is over . From now on ( well , last year on ) my brother is constantly going to be away save for holidays . And this is my last year at home , but I 'm so excited to get out , no disrespect , but having life away from home is awesome . ( see last year ) . And we 're going to be all over the globe . Cuz that 's how I want to be , always traveling . This is my list : Japan ( mou ikkai ) ; Europe-including England , Scotland , France , Italy , Greece , Spain , Sweden ; and I want to go to Papau New Guinea , and Fiji . We 'll see how many I actually get to . Oh yeah , and Korea ( as in South ) . Lalala , today was productive . It 's always the productive days that make me feel the fullest at the end of it . Tomorrow will be productive also . And on Sunday : church ! Second time this year ... this month ... I always post at night . I wonder if I blogged in , say , the morning , if I would have a different attitude ... less `` night-y '' ? Omoshiroi ! haha I ca n't keep a steady stream of thought , I 'm going to bed . Oyasumi nasai .
