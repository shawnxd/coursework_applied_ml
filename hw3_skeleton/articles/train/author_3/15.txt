To make a long story short , concise and to-the-point : I will be away from Saturday , July 24th to an undecided date at the end of the summer . Maybe I 'll come back for a week in August , still undecided . I am going to Camp MiniYoWe ! To be a camp counsellor for my 3rd year running . I am so excited , and I get to drive the van up ( it 's kinda `` my car '' ) . So that 's that , and I hope to see some people at the end of the summer and if not ... till commencement , and best of luck in university ! or wherever the next chapter goes . PS -- > I turn 18 on August 17th ! Think of me on that most delightful of days ! PPS -- > If you 'd like you can send me a letter/note/postcard/card/anything in the mail to where I 'll be ( I 'd smile ) this is the address : Jenny Nasmith ( Tuxedo ) Girls ' Camp Camp Mini-Yo-We 1878 Muskoka Road # 10 West - RR # 2 Port Sydney , Ontario , Canada P0B 1L0
