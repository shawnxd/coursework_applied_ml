I type , post and write in this blog just because i like to have somewhere to put all my thoughts ( of the moment ) . So , it could be assumed that I type not really caring who is or who is not reading this . But that strange part is , after I find out people are reading it ( like the Itariajin , - yoroshiku - and other friends of mine ) , I will probably post more often just because I am entertained by the idea of an audience . I am not sure if that actually is ironic , but it seemed ironic a few moments ago .
