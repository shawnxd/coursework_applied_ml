I 've never had cramps during my period before . Never . For me , my uterus was always an afterthought , an minor inconvenience , a mark on my underwear that would wash out in the sink if I caught it early enough . Thats not how it feels now . It is n't unbearable , but it is persistant . I feel like my lower body is being squeezed too tightly , like its all constricted inside . I try lying down and all it does is make me bored and uncomfortable . I try ignoring it , and it still persists . Its like an ugly secret that wo n't go away , and since I do n't believe in complaining to any person ( computers do n't count ) , I just keep thinking about it . I can see how miserable it would be for people not to believe you . My neighbor ( who 's in her mid fourties ) grew up at the time when people were still insisting that menstruel cramps were physcological . Every month , she got piercing cramps that kept her in bed for at least two days . Her parents took her to the doctor , who told them that she was an artistic type , prone to such problems . That 's terrible ! I mean , if someone were to tell me that my cramps were n't real , I 'd probably want to be very violent . Still , I can see how easy it would be to deny . I never thought other women were faking cramps , but I did n't feel that bad for them . It had never bothered me so I did n't really think about them as that terrible . I think thats a very human tendency to ignore what does n't affect one 's self . Still , it 's one that must be fought . Because even if I do n't get confined to a bed two days out of a month , my neighbor still gets that bad , even after two kids . Even if mine are n't that bad , someone else 's are worse . Even if I never felt anything , someone else did .
