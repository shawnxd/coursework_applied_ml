I 'm at Dad 's house again , and wow , what an adjustment . Its always when I go there after being at mom 's or away for a while . The thing is that he always expects me to act in certain ways , and I 'm never good at being that person . See , Dad ( and Janie ) tend to value appearances much more than sincerity or for that matter , reality . They 're the type who like it when someone looks smart more than when they really are smart . I mean , they 're nice to me ( at least right now ) because I 'm going along with what they say . It 's when I disagree , or when I do n't want to do what they tell me that they freak out ... Anyways , I 'm reading The Truth by Terry Pratchett . T'is a very funny diskworld novel about the beginnings of a newspaper in Ankh Morpork . There are so many good quotes ... I 'll put some up later ( or not , they might float off into space with the EE Cummings poems I was going to post ) . The best parts involve the vampire photographer . He takes a picture , then because of the flash , rolls around screaming in pain and turns into dust . Then he recovers and does it again ... bwa ha ha . After this , I really will have to read the last of my poetry books . The Ape Woman Story actually looks pretty good ... its just that after the Girls on the Run fiasco , I went into poetry overload and needed to recover with some witty prose . Anyways , I 'm gon na go read some more . I 'll post again soon ...
