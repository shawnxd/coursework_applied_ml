Thats the gist of what my friend just said . True , I was not having the best time in my life . True , I probably could have been more talkative if I had put in an effort . STILL , that is no reason to assume that I had a bad time ! I went out with two of my friends for the first time in a few weeks ( we were finally all in the same place at the same time ! ) . Unfortunately , three other people from their school came along . Not that I do n't like them ... I just do n't know them . So , they all talked about school stuff coming up ... and I sat there . Smay kept looking at me and saying `` talk ! `` , but really , I did n't know what to talk about , and no one was really that interested in listening anyway . So everyone was going to go back to Sarah 's afterwards , and Smay goes `` You can go home if you want , I do n't really care since you did n't have any fun anyway '' . WHO THE HELL SAYS I HAD NO FUN . I wanted to fucking see them ! I wanted to ! I 'm tired of being the only one sitting at home on the fucking computer because no one else wants to talk to me ! I 'm tired of it , and if that means I need to learn how to talk fluff , or learn how to sit there being quiet , I 'll fucking do it . In truth , it was ok . I felt kind of left out , but I do regret going home . Everyone else is heading to Sarah 's , where they 'll all do exactly the same thing , and it would have been no more fun to go there , but I still regret it . So the question I have to ask myself is ... is it better to have a kind of unfun time with friends or a boring time alone ? The answer ? I just do n't know right now .
