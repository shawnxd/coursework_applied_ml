I do n't know . I guess that is the conclusion of this post . The truth is that I 'm simply pondering something that is not really going to change , and that I would n't change . I really do like my friends . I like talking to them . I like interacting with them . I like having someone to talk to . The thing is that I ca n't talk about everything with them . Namely , I ca n't talk about politics or philosophy . The reason for this is that 1 ) they do n't know much about these topics and 2 ) they are n't really interested in them . This is fine , except that I feel as if I 'm leading two lives . I can talk to certain friends who live out of town about those subjects , and I do so regularly . Its just that I ca n't talk to them about it when I 'm thinking about it . For instance , today I had been reading the news . I read the newspaper pretty regularly , but when I read the news online , its because I 'm thinking about stuff . I proceeded to start talking about it with my friend , and then I realized that she hated it . We do n't agree on politics . We never have , and unless she has some radical change in her life , we never will . Still , the fact that we could n't even discuss it without her breaking into hives ( she just hates talking about it , it is n't just me ) bothered me . In other news , I tried to find a job at a bookstore for the school year , and I failed miserably . Apparently , most of the bookstores are n't really interested in part time help . Oh well . At least I 'll still have time for speech and debate ... I 'm currently avoiding my summer reading ( still ) and am reading Wise Blood by Flannory O'Connor . Its good . I like how she writes ; its very concise , and yet , it manages to capture the thought process of the narrator in third person . Yay for third person limited !
