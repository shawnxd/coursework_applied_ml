I am at TIP . HOORAY . Ok , so politics and economics has been ok ( even though I miss consensus and am annoyed with certain people in my class ) . Currently , we are learning about how the global economy works , and since I do not fully understand it quite yet , I will post on that topic later . What I can say is that I 've achieved a better understanding of how globalization has become the main global system . I 've also learned how the internet and increased technology has factored into democratizing information and decisions . I love seeing my friends . Its a lot different here ; I 'm not afraid of talking about stuff , and I do n't have to worry about my family . I 'll talk about this more later , but since I 'm in the library and will have to leave soon , I think I 'll do some other stuff ( like email my parents ) . Oh well ...
