Maybe its just a writer 's thing , but I hate titles . They 're lame and stupid and have to be changed ten thousand times because no one ever thinks they 're appropriate . So , moving on ... I finished In the Shadow of Man by Jane Goodall a few days ago . I really liked it , but I 'm having trouble bringing myself to write the report on it . Right now , I 'm reading Little , Big by John Crowley because I ca n't bring myself to start A People 's History of the United States by Howard Zinn back up . Its just a little too much socialism and american history for me . Little , Big is amazing . I love the way he writes . He manages to make everything sound elegant and beautiful . I also like that he combines magic and modern day without making it seem cheesy . There 's this one section called `` Suppose one were a Fish '' , and every time I read it ( I 've reread this part several times because its amazing ) I get shivers . I had started reading it last year at the suggestion of a friend , but after summer reading got evil , I had to put it aside . I 'm glad I picked it up , though , because its amazing . All my friends are gone . Smay 's in europe have a super fabulous time . The twins ( though they 'd kill me if I said `` the twins '' in front of them ) are in Florida . My other friends have jobs and family obligations . Boredom is really consuming . Still , I did see Farenheight 911 the other day . I do n't trust Michael Moore as far as information goes ( he really is n't that accurate ) , but he 's definately hilarious , and he makes some good points . I like the part where he tries to get congressmen to enlist their children in the military . Also , the part where he reads the Patriot Act in front of the Capitol is great . I have n't been writing anything . I thought I was going to be writing another long story , maybe shoot for a novel , but I just have n't been doing it . I 've been really lazy , and I need to get back into it . Oh well .
