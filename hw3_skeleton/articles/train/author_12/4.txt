`` The more patriotic the name , the more fascist the policy . Soon the government will announce operation `` Apple Pie '' which will allow national guardsmen to shoot American citizens whenever they feel like it . '' Hangly Man ( someone from the internet whom I have never contacted , but whose quote was lying around ) It 's too damn true and its scary . `` No Child Left Behind '' `` The Patriot Act '' `` Operation Iraqi Freedom '' Does anything ever just have a neutral name ? Obviously , they would n't name it `` Flaming Piece of Shit That Everyone Should Vote Against if They Are Slightly Decent '' but the fact that every name is so charged really gets on my nerves . This was bothering me during student congress because I was surrounded by conservatives . Not only did I have to argue against six sevenths of the room , but I had to argue against names that affect people in a subtle manner . It is n't as if anyone would take the name at face value , but when you are arguing against something like that , you are immediately put on the defensive . Not only are you arguing why the bill is bad , but you 're arguing why you are n't bad . I HATE THAT . One day , I 'm going to write a bill for student congress that will be named `` The American Act '' and we shall see how well that gets passed ... I 'll probably make it outlaw something ridiculous . Any good ideas for what this bill , tell me . I 'm only writing right now because I 'm bored , so I 'm going to go play minesweeper . My record on expert is 110 seconds , but I shall improve .
