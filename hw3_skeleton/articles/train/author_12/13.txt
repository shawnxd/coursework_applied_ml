And I 'm too lazy to retype it , so bah . I 've read The Lexus and the Olive Tree by Thomas Friedman in its entirety . It is a book about globalization and its benefits and what must be done to make it better . Right now , I 'm reading Madame Secretary by Madeleine Albright . 'T is quite good , and it is interesting to hear her recount what happened during the Rwandan Genocide . What struck me was that she asserted that they had very little information at the time of what exactly was happening . Is that true ? Hopefully . I do n't want to think about how upsetting it would be to know that policy makers knew all this and did nothing . The funny thing about Madeleine Albright is that she looks just like my grandmother . They look so similar that my brother commented on it when my book was just laying on the table . Apparently , they even walked the same before Bubbie started having back problems . Ok , right now my room is a mess and school is about to start . I have to do all these assignments for NOCCA , and 't is annoying because it all seems to be sneaking up on me . I 'm sick of writing for now , so I 'm going to go . Farethewell ...
