Ok , I took time out from Little , Big to read The Wee Free Men by Terry Pratchett . Its a lighter read , and I had finished it by 5 that night . Now , I 'm going to be getting back to Little , Big It really is a fantastic book . The writing is superb , and the story is interesting . Its just that ... I feel compelled to put it down every five pages or so because it has so many sections . Its strange ... Tommorrow is the Fourth of July , which is Smay and Richard 's birthdays . That is why I am happy . NOT because I am patriotic in any way . Well , I could be ... if I knew what patriotism was . As far as I can tell , everyone has a different definition of it , and uses that definition to their advantage . I refuse to be part of any label that I can not define . I am a feminist . I am left leaning politically . I am a tenative athiest . I am a reader . TIP is a week away tommorrow . I ca n't wait ! I 'm really looking foreward to it , and mom 's having me start preparing already , so I can feel it coming . Yay !
