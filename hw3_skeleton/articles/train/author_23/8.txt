Sweet Surrender - Sarah McLachlan it does n't mean much it does n't mean anything at all the life I 've left behind me is a cold room I 've crossed the last line from where I ca n't return where every step I took in faith betrayed me and led me from my home and sweet sweet surrender is all that I have to give you take me in no questions asked you strip away the ugliness that surrounds me are you an angel am I already that gone I only hope that I wo n't disappoint you when I 'm down here on my knees and sweet sweet sweet surrender is all that I have to give sweet sweet sweet surrender is all that I have to give and I do n't understand by the touch of your hand I would be the one to fall I miss the little things oh I miss everything it does n't mean much it does n't mean anything at all the life I left behind me is a cold room
