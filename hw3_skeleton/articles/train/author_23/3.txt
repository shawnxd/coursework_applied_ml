Well yesterday and today are much better days . I guess you get one of those days once in a while where u think you 're going to lose it and nothing can help . I got a nice t-shirt tan on one side of my arms at the picnic at our church . I wore my new skirt that I made myself . It looked sooooooooo pretty . LOL . I liked it . well I think it 's about time to shave my legs . They 've been hairy for too long . But it 's not like they 're so visible and all . They are n't . LOL . Well its a nice day . I 'm off to do stuff ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Tootles .
