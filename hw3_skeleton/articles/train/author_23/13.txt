Well , before this post I was improvising a poem . I got fed up with it because it sounded corny , even though it was from the heart . I gave up writing poems for a while . And now I remember why . hahah . oooooo ... ..Good times . Well the heat has been awful today . It leaves me weak , unable to breathe at times ( just like the song by Maroon 5 - harder to breathe ) it 's a good song . But the sun always leaves a smile on my face . We 're learning about different religions this semester . Mostly about spirituality . I feel that in my life , especially at this moment , I am lacking in that section . I do n't have time . I really do n't . Does that make me a bad person . I sure hope not . It 's just that I really do n't think I can calm myself down to the point where I am totally silent , with no thoughts in my head , or anything to bother me for that matter . Something always comes up with is urgent , and well that is my first priority . Maybe later it will change . We 'll just have to see . I am currently memorizing a monologue for drama class . It 's from the movie and book `` white oleander '' . It 's real good . But it 's deep stuff . hahah . I 'd like to end up seeing this movie . Maybe with my mom . It seems like one of those mother and daughter movies . oooooooooooo , u know what I have n't had in a long time . A movie night . I need one of those . Hmmmmmmmm , what movies , so many that I want to see but I am completely blank . Oh well . My memory is n't as good as it used to be . Wait , a sec . It was never that good to begin with . hahaha . Ok well I got to get back to memorizing it , and also the French project and studying for the science and fashion in class exam . yay ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Tootles -Ela
