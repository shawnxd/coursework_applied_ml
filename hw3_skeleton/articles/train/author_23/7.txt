I 'm tired of all of this , you know when you get into one of those hopeless moods where you do n't want to do anything just sit at home , but you also do n't want to sit at home . I hate it , despise it . LOL . All I can do is laugh . Crying is for the weak . I do n't think I have reached that point yet . I am lost . I do n't know who to listen to . Who to believe . And I have lost friends because of that before , but they do n't understand that I care about them , that I really do n't mean what I did . I cared so much about them that when I heard something about them I started to doubt that that friend was really my friend , maybe it was a game they were playing , just to make fun of me in the end . I think like that a lot . I think low of me . But that will never change . You need to understand that . That that 's who I am . I 'm sorry about everything . But I feel that I 'm the one always saying sorry . I have feelings too . But you do n't seem to see that . What can I do , but think , I need to stop thinking . I always tell everyone that but I should start listening to myself for once . I need to take under consideration about my feelings . But I 'm scared that others will think I 'm conceded . When really I 'm not . I know I should n't care what others think . And I also tell other people that too . But it 's hard . It 's hard not to care . Very hard not to care .
