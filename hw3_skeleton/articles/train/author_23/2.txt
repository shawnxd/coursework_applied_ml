Welcome to my summer ... ... ... What is it exactly that I 'm doing right now . NOTHING . LOL . Well relaxing before camp . Camp is in a week . I 'm excited . It 's real fun . You do n't have to believe me , and you may think as if going to camp is a little odd . It 's not . It 's way more than that . Well I 'm not going to spend all this time explaining about it . So I 'll change subjects . My birthday is in 6 days . I 'm turning 17 . Wow , how slow getting older is . Anyway ... ..I do n't mind . More time to have a different kind of fun . I do n't like birthdays , well my birthdays . It 's a normal day . I like going to other peoples b-day parties but not mine . I do n't now why . But I just like it that way . And I 'm not sad , I 'm happy , so it 's all good . Well , i have to get back to doing nothing , I think the laundry is done . Got to check on that . Tootles -Ela
