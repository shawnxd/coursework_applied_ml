My father and I ate dinner together alone at the kitchen table . A very awkward moment in both our lives . You see my mother had n't get come home from work and my brother had n't come home from his residence either . They 're both late . And I always make dinner on time so well , my father and I ate . It 's not that my father and I do n't get along it 's just that we really do n't have anything to talk about . It 's either him complaining at me for watching TV when he wants to , or me complaining to him why he leaves the kitchen a mess . Well , we sat in silence . In uttermost silence . He usually takes his dinner plate and ate in front of the TV , but no , not today . So sat looking at my plate , him at his . Eventually he sat beside the TV . It was the longest 10 min of my life . I ate almost nothing so slowly that it took forever . Well my mother just arrived , I have to talk to her about her day , and o crap ! I was supposed to make a list of groceries , o well . I 'll do it quickly now . Tootles
