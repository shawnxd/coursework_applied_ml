So I lied , I said I 'd write tomorrow but I did n't . Too much to do , and I do n't always feel like writing . So Thursdays athletic banquet was awesome . I had heaps of fun . Wish it would never end . Our table started out being Andrea , Liz and me . Then a group of guys joined us , because well , we 're just so great to get along with , LOL . Saturday was also really fun . We had our bieg for scouts . Then the picnic afterwards , where I got to see the guy that came from Australia that I have n't seen for almost a year now . It was great to hear his Australian accent , but he 's lost some of it . That 's too bad . The guys played soccer , us girls had a water fight , then we played volleyball . My arms are nice and burning at this moment , but they 're not as bad as my face . It wo n't be that bad tomorrow , I hope . Hehehehe . Then I slept over at Gosia and Ania 's house . We rented American Beauty . It 's a twisted movie . I guess if I saw it again maybe I 'd understand it a bit more . But the young crazy guy who films everything in the movie is hot . In a mysterious kind of way . Today we had Boze Cialo at our church . So more sun and walking around the neighborhood in our scouts uniform . It not that bad . After that my family and I went to my cousin 's house for her birthday get together . She turned 5 last week . And see gets hyper and more hyper by the day . I ended up taking a nap on my aunts couch . I do n't know why I was so tired . I got like 10 hours of sleep last night . I 'm going to blame it on all the sun . hehehe . Yes , that 's a good excuse . And now I 'm trying to study for my first exam . Drama . It 's a written exam and well , I am not good at that . Oh well , I 'll try my best . But I hate studying . We 'll wee how it goes . I 'll write more when I got time , or something interesting happens . Tootles -Ela
