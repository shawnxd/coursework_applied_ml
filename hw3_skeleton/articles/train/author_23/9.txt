I need you right now . Right this minute . I have no idea who you are . I do n't know if I already have met you . Maybe we 're friends . Maybe there 's something more between us . I just know that I 'm alone . Some thing is missing and at this exact moment I 'm falling apart inside . Who are you ? Where can I find you ? Help me out please ? I know you are out there . You 're watching right this minute . And as you read this , you know there 's nothing you can do . Time will explain everything . Well , I want it to explain now ! Why is this taking longer than I hoped it would . Why ca n't you see that I like you . I don ; t want to be blunt about it . But I wish you 'd give some kind of hint . Maybe you 're not the one . If not , then I 'm happy that we 're just they way we are . But if there is more ... .. I want to know . But only , when the time is right . And it seems as if I ca n't wait any longer , time for me is right now . And if not for you . Sorry . I waited out as long as I could . But there 's still a chance . I 'll be waiting for you . For the one , who I do n't know .
