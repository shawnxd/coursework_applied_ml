The sound , the known anger , the blinding dramatic light . Last night was scary as hell . Ok so it may sound a little too over dramatic , but I was surely scared as hell . I dislike thunderstorms . To begin with a quick flash of light is never good . It 's like turning around to see a train a second before it hits you . Or like they say , when u die you 'll see a bright light . You see that lighting is not a good thing . And thunder . It 's like a loud crashing noise , and that means destruction . As you can see this whole thunderstorm thing is so awful . I like rain . I love rain . But just Rain . Alone , with no extras . Ok , well I 'm sleeping when suddenly I wake up because of the storm . I look at my clock it 's around 12:30 ish . The rain is falling in my room , so I go across to the window and close my window . The second I am doing that I see a flash of light , then the sound of thunder and then all the street lights go out . I glance at my clock and it 's flashing . My heart is beating at it 's fastest . I 'm a little chicken when it comes to these things . I have a fear of getting struck by lightning . I try to convince my self that , if I do get struck then it 's ok . It 's not my fault I could n't prevent it . And dying is ok . But last night I was scared to death . I considered going to my parents room and crawling into bed with them as I had done many many years ago . But I was too afraid of opening my door and crossing the hallway . So I jumped into bed , put the covers over my face and ears , and a while later found myself fast asleep . I woke up in the morning tired as hell and oh so hot . I should n't have covered myself with all the blankets and closing the window was n't a good idea . Well , that 's all for today folks . Now you all know one of my fears . And I tell ya , there 's way more to come . Tootles -Ela
