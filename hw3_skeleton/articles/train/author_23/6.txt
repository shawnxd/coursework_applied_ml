Well today I woke up nice and early for no apparent reason . There is no school today , no early appointments , no flippin ' reason at all . Yet I am totally awake and functioning well . I woke up at 5 am thought , `` it 's my first day of summer vacation go back to sleep '' . Then every half hour I woke up , and made myself crawl back into bed . At 7 I finally decided there is no point in this all and got up . My father was still sleeping my mother already left to work . With nothing else to do I went on msn . Then checked out the forum . I found myself watching the college years of saved by the bell . Even though I 've seen all the episodes it still interest me . Anywho , then I started watching this movie on the superstation , do n't remember what it 's called but it 's an ok movie . I started watching Live with Regis and Kelly . The shows been better before . Now it 's so repetitive , it bores me . They should get like Brad Pitt to go on the show . Then I 'd watch it . Well , I have a few things on my agenda today . I have to wash my hair , do some grocery shopping for tonight 's dinner which I am making . Then possibly do some laundry , vacuum , clan my mess , wash my bathroom , and the list goes on . I 'll be happy if I get the first two done . LOL . Well I think it 's time for that shower . O man I hate walking to the store . There 's so much construction going on and all the guys working there start screaming something in Spanish to me . I just ignore them . I feel so violated . LOL . I need to learn Spanish so I can yell something mean back to them . LOL . And they 're all ugly so yeah . well I 'm off ... ... ... ... ... Tootles
