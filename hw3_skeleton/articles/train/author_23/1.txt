Well , I think this is going to be interesting . I hate hand writing in journals , and I recently just found this amazing site that all I have to do is type , and well , out comes this journal . It even has spell check , wow , can it get even easier . Some may be wondering , `` why make a journal , what 's so important for you to say and for us to listen to '' . Exactly my point . Let 's just say it 's a fresh start to my self realization . Yes , I have n't been exactly finding the real me in others , so I though , why , a good start is to stop taking what other people say too seriously and just focus on me . I have much to say , and I hope that my procrastination does n't result in this journal not being written in for days on end . Well , what can I start with . School is killing me at the moment . I hate work . It 's a pet peeve of mine . But I 've got to live with it . The only thing that 's keeping me going is knowing that it 's all over in two weeks , excluding exam days , and summer is oh so very near . Cheerleading , what can I say about that . It 's fun . The people there are great . It 's an over all great experience . But what if you wake up in the morning dreading going to practice that day . That 's exactly what I 'm going through . I have n't found an activity that I could stick with for a longer period of time . I 've tried ballet , ballroom , polish dancing , track , cheerleading , and I feel that I 'm still missing out on something , and that none of these is really my passion . So I 've decided that two years in cheerleading is enough for me . Maybe I 'll go back to track next year . We 'll see how it goes . Well that 's enough writing for tonight . Do n't worry there will be more to come . Take Care . Do n't drink and drive . : ) Tootles -ela
