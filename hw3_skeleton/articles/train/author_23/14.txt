Yeah I found this funny quote today : New ! Improved ! Instant ass hole ... Just add alcohol ! Ooooooooo , that was good . It 's not always true . But it can give you a good laugh . Well today was a long day . It has been , and will continue to be the longest week of school . And the reason behind it is , that it 's the last week of school before exams and well , it just drags on . Today was the last day of scouts . It 's about time it 's over . It 's been going on for too long . But it surely has been worth while . The heat is coming in . And life with out A.C is going to kill me . Oh well at least I got a nice and cool basement to turn to . Except for the fact that it 's unfinished , dusty , and scares the heck out of me . I 'll get used to it . Not to worry . Well , I officially need a break . Just to get away for one day , or longer . Maybe go to the beach , or somewhere nice . Away from my family . Somewhere with friends . After exams and before camp . That 's the perfect time . I need time off from thinking . Yet , there will always continue to be a million things going on at the same time and I 'll get so lazy that 's I 'll probably end up finishing none of them . Well , that 's me for you . One big procrastinator . I try not to be . But it gets the best of us , sometimes . Ok , I have so much to do and maybe I 'll end up doing something . Tootles -Ela
