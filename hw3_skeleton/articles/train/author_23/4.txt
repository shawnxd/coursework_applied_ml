Holding it in , going to lose control any second , got to seem strong , got to seem tough . How much longer will this shit last , how much more of this am I going to have to hold back . Have to pretend it does n't hurt me , while inside I weep . At times it surfaces , I let out my weaknesses , but no , never again , I am not like that . I am not who you think I am . I am not what you expect me to be . I will not give in to your schemes . I will not become just like you . I forgot who I really am . I forgot what it feels like to be happy . I do n't know what I like anymore . I do n't know what makes my happy . I want to change me , I do n't like who I am . I want to become a different person , different pleases me . I will hold in what I can . I will never forget how you did me wrong . I am who I am . I do n't care what you think .
