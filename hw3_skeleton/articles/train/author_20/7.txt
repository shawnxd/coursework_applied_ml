This is Ken 's buddy John Wong from Montreal . I used to run for pride , but decided that was overrated . Now I run just to eat guilt free . Mmm.. munch munch munch . You would not believe how often I 've recited , `` eat guilt free '' as my mantra during my harder segments of my run . Tonight I have hill work with the Running Room in Outremont . It 's a place near my highschool where we will be doing 10 hill repeats . Thank goodness there 's a gourment ice cream place just around the corner from the store . I just picked up my train ticket for Toronto . I ca n't believe it . Now that I 've actually forked out the dough for the train ticket , there 's no turning back now . Half marathon here I come . It 's a good thing that Ken knows first aid . I might put his knowledge to the test . Until the next blog , Eatin ' guilt free JW
