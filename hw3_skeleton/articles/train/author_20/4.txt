August 5 2004 5:30pm Running group MAA led by Dorys weather 20 degrees with light breeze . Who I ran with Mary and Annie What I ate before : prune What I drank before : water Effort 8 on 10 How I felt before slightly tired ( legs from yesterdays hill work ) but generally in good spirits Jog to the park from the gym was done at base pace on an uphill slope . Felt good going up the hill not too laboured as I found the proper pace early The course is a 400 meter loop . The goal 3x3 with a 2 minute rest between sets . Run each of the 9 laps in an even a time as possible . Dorys ran with us to trick us into running faster . We all fell for it . First set of three : 1:51 , 1:58 , 1:55 Second set of three : 1:55 , 1:52 , 1:57 Third set of three : 1:51 , 153 , 1:45 How I felt afterward , winded . Quick recovery but legs were tired . Nice jog back to gym . Minimal effort . No mosquitos ( yay ! ) Duration 1 hour Stretching 10 minutes . Concerns : Recovery for Sunday long run
