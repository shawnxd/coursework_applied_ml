August 7th 7:30am Ran with Running Room Distance : 23km ( ended up being 24.5 for me ) How I felt before : Tired slept late not a good sleep What I ate : Yogurt and a banana What I wore , Sugoi long sleeve , shorts , wrightsock and Asics Nimbus V Running group only 6 people No running buddy in particular floated around The first five km were the hardest . I struggled to find the proper pace and rhythm . The long sleeve shirt made things less comfortable than usual ( I 'm used to tank tops ) I had the zipper all the way down . The temp warmed up slightly and the humidity was rising ( difficulty 5-6 on ten ) After first 10km broke from the pack and ran 5km by myself and then returned to the pack . Ten and ones were helpful . I could feel the fatigue set in . Sprinted the last km ( 4:45 ) and stretched were . How I felt during the run . Great . At km 19 Dimitra , Alain and myself were sprinting . 4:50/km It felt really great as there was a light cross breeze . Concerns : I weighed myself yesterday and following the run at the gym and at home and I lost 6 pound . I went from 144 to 138 lbs , representing a 4.10 % drop . Must have been water weight but I rehydrated and did not feel thirsty . Hmm.. Effort was there but I need to rest better .
