Well , finally did my first run in almost a week . It 's definitely not the type of laziness that I want to repeat . While I was able to complete a half hour run , I was exhausted afterwards . Much of it can be attributed to the fact that I have n't ran in a while . I believe the rest of my difficulties come from the fact that I 've been on a tread mill for most of my previous runs . My run today consisted of humid weather , cool breezes , and ridiculously hilly roads . All of which you do n't find in a gym on a treadmill ... I also noticed that my knees were getting kinda sore from running outside . I think that has to do with some of the uneven terrain that I was dealing with today . All in all , it was a good run . Roughly 5km in a half hour so I 'm pretty close to my target speed . Wish me luck tommorow when I do another short run during lunch .
