August 11 , 2004 Time 6:00pm Location : Running Rooom in Outremont Group 1/2 marathoners Weather 20 degrees Humidity factor 4/10 Distance 3 km , 9 hill repeats and 3km back How I felt before . good and solid ( no injuries , or tenderness ) How I felt during : expected difficulty in the latter hills and I did . ( hills 8 and 9 ) Met new people . Initially no one is talkative and people talk to themselves but toward the end , everyone came around and was chatty . My other group ( marathon ) was upset that I chose hills over fartlek . I ran fartlek in the rain on Tuesday and needed to develop leg strength . Tonight I have fartlek with the easy group in the park . I need to pick and choose my spots . As the races draw closer and closer , I need to be very selective in terms of the workouts I follow . Sprint finish . I was running sub 5min/km . This is for real . I had thought previously that it was a fluke being able to post up such a time but I am finally coming into my own . I just to continue that work . So much to do so little time . How I felt physically afterward . Really , really tired . Was n't in the mood to socialize . Ate and went to bed . Lost weight . Now I 'm a size 28 . Concerns : Will I be able to post a 4 hour time . Hmmm..
