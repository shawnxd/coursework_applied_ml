Finally made it out for one of my short runs again ( should 've been yesterday but I was tired and lazy =P ) . Ran alone during lunch hour , hot and sunny weather but a good strong breeze to cool off in while running . 8km/43 minutes on fairly flat terrain with a hill at about the 6 km mark . All in all , a very good short run for me . Very good morale booster ... makes me want to run more . = ) Started the run with a fair amount of ... trepidation ? The first 10 minutes were difficult , felt tired and stiff ( even after stretching ) . The next 20 minutes were fairly easy and relaxed once I got into a good rhythm . Last 12 minutes were without breeze and so I had to work for the final leg of my run . : ) Finish felt awesome ! A fairly sharp pain in right shin at the halfway mark that passed in a few minutes ( about 6 out of 10 I 'd say ) . Left knee felt a little sore while running . Should heal before I do my long run on Sunday . As a side note , did some weight training with my PT this morning that helped a lot I think . Now that I 've been training for a few weeks , I think my schedule will be : Monday : evening short run . Wednesday : morning workout , lunch/evening short run . Friday : morning workout w/ PT , lunch/evening short run . Sunday : morning long run .
