August 10 2004 5:30pm Location 1km loop around the park behind the statue Running group MAA led by Dorys advance group Weather : humid ( air was warm and heavy factor 8/10 ) light breeze , intermittent and sporadic What I ate prior , 2 yogurt and 1 banana 2 hours prior How a I felt : legs slightly stiff from Sunday 's long run but generally alright Ran from the gym to the the beginning of the loop ( long way ) 15 min Piece : Run for 5 min at 85 % ( 10km pace ) and rest for 2:30 return to the start position for each loop . Each lap was completed prior to the 5 min elasping . By the 3rd loop we were caught in a heavy rain which lasted for 20 min . Shoes soaked up water like a sponge . Shorts were tight and clingy . T-shirt as well . Tracked dirt all over my calves , butt and lower half of the back of my t-shirt . Good thing according to Dorys , under the Pose technique dirt is supposed to be thrown up that high . He was sporting dirt completed down his back . Following the rain the veil of humidity was lifted and the run became simpler despite our clothes restricting us . I was able to complete my final lap in 4:42 . Felt great . Perhaps I might be able to run a sub 45 min 10km . Wishfull thinking ? Hmm ... . Did not have time to strectch . Sand all over the place . Felt great . No pain following day .
