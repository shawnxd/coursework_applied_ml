The past long weekend was a complete bust in terms of training . Very very dissapointing for me . I think it had to do with the fact that my past week has been kinda busy and that I did n't get as much sleep as I required . Too many things going on alongside my training . Today I turned that around though . I spent about 40 minutes in the gym this morning doing my basic weight training exercises as outlined by my personal trainer . Feeling good about myself this morning . Enough that I 'm planning on doing a short run during lunch or after work ( 3 - 4 miles ) . With any luck , I 'll be able to complete the full training schedule that my PT laid out for me before the end of the week without killing myself . : ) BTW , my PT sent me this link about running which I thought was an excellent short read urlLink Running : the difference between 'style ' and proper technique
