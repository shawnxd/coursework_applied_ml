Completed a 30 minute 5km run today at noon . Second outdoor run in the past month and the shin splints did n't hit me ... Awesome ! Slight tightening of the muscles around the shin and knees while I was running but I think the biggest obstacle for me today was the heat . Lotsa sun , very little wind . Luckily I was wearing one of those cool technical t-shirts that wick away sweat otherwise it would 've been unbearable ! Exhausting and rewarding . Looking forward to the weight training tommorow morning . Not looking forward to the evening outdoor run I have planned for myself .
