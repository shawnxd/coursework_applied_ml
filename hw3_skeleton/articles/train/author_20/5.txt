First hill repeat fatigue and stiffness . natural feel did not start yet By the third repeat , I finally established in a rhythm . Fatigue was still present but waning . Pace : Up and down at same pace . Remained consistent and chatted with Donald . Did not stop once nor took water break . Final hill , sprinted vs Donald ( won- yay ! ) Post race , stomach felt queasy . legs felt heavy quck recovery from sprint . Relaxed as the weather cooled ( overcast + slight breeze ) . Waiting 10 min then proceeded to final 3km run to the store . Sprinted ( 10km pace ) in the final 1km to the store . Queasiness subsided . Following day : legs still feeling heavy . Emotionally : Good but will feel better when legs have fully recovered . On the menu for tonight : Interval training at the 1 km loop in the park with the running group at the gym . Concerns : need to log in more mid distance runs .
