For those who have n't talked to me in awhile , I should let you know that I hired a personal trainer at Goodlife Fitness to help me get back onto my feet in terms of running ( no pun intended ... haha ) . She 's a sub-4 marathon runner and she 's currently training for the New York Marathon this year which I think is absolutely awesome . Could n't have asked for a more appropriate ( or better ) trainer . Today marks session 2 ( out of 10 ) and we normally cover weight training over the half hour session since that 's where I seem to have the most difficulty . I find that I 'm always pushing myself too hard or too little when it comes to weight training but my PT seems to have nailed the correct weights for me to use on the various exercises . In fact , I 'm already noticing subtle differences after 3 or 4 weight training sessions which is pretty cool . Maybe it 's in my head , but hey , either way , it 's a great little ego boost for me . : D Did some squats , bench press , leg curls , lat pull down , lower back , and ab exercises today ... I think I 'll do my last 2 runs on Saturday and Sunday just so that I do n't push too hard . I 've got high hopes for the half marathon in September ... I 'm hitting my weekly goal of 4 runs a week and weight training twice a week . All in all , I think I 'll be able to give my buddy John a run for his money . ( no pun intended ... haha )
