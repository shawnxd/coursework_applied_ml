The past week has been a complete writeoff . I did n't mean for it to happen , but the facts remain the same . I have n't had any training at all over the past week . The entire week was spent getting my car fixed , driving to and from TO , seeing friends/girlfriend , work , sja , and getting that damn little PC of mine up and running again . The end result was me being exhausted for the entire week . No joke . I feel like a lump right now at work . I 'm getting a ton of stuff done but I 'm so exhausted it 's not funny . In my defense , I tried running last night . I was feeling alright in the evening , clouds were rolling in but it was n't raining yet . So , I stretched and hit the road . 10 minutes in , the shin splints started kicking in on my right leg . Not a good sign . Not sure what I 'll do except talk to my PT about it tommorow . The strangest thing was that when I started running yesterday , I felt ... lopsided ? ... off kilter ? ... like I could n't get my gait right . I 'm hoping that it had to do with the fact that I had n't run in almost a week . Which could have led to my shin splint due to awkward strides ? I dunno . I 'll talk to my PT tommorow and see what she says . Not to worry though . My payment is in , I 'm *registered* for the half marathon . One way of the other , I 'm crossing that finish line baby !
