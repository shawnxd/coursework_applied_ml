Well Hello out there ! It is an absolutly beautiful day out here in craptown WI . I love it . I stayed after work today to play dodgeball with some local little kids . It was fun . I also played with a few friends from school and a few co workers . My song title day is a harsh one , I know . The sad thing is ; however , that I find it to be true . That no particular insignificant person receives any amount of gratitude or satisfaction worth their time ... until they are buried . There are , of course , exceptions to my little revelation and I live for exceptions . But who cares . It 's a solid theory . I tried to counter that theory by thanking the first person who commented on my blog with an email . I also told them that I will update it just for them . I hope they will hold me to that . I meant it . So , I officially dedicate this post to my first commenter ! ! ! Thanks ! ! ! ... . 10 points to the first person to guess what band my title is from today . If I can get an email , I 'll even email the points to you , personally . I know , it 's incredible . But I guess I 'm just giving like that . This is a decent length post . Enjoi and Au Revoir ! ! Band of the day time ... . New Found Glory ( I love em so ! ! ! )
