Hey all . I had a nice relaxing saturday today . Slept till about 1130 and then decided to start thinking about the future . Up until this point I had decided to go to college around here and then possibly La Crosse . But now I 've had a change of mind and the colleges I have been looking at are half way across the country . This , to say the least , is slightly troubling . I grew up around here . But then I have to realize that I wo n't be seeing the same people that I would normally see . I just do n't know . But I had better decide soon . The Dells was nuts last night . We went go karting but then it rained . So we slid all over the track and we smashed each other up pretty good . It was fun . I hate neon 's . A lot . So on the way home I pulled up next to one and revved my engine . He was pissed . The events that ensued were 3 near accidents and a car full of adrenaline rushed 17 year old guys . IT ROCKED ... . I 'm gon na be doing some tweaking on both this blog and my other one . So forgive the crude ugly smacktacular state of them if such a view should arise . Do n't flame me . Band of the day ... Taking Back Sunday
