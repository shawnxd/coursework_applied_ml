Today is officialy the 100th day left on the Halo 2 Countdown . I do n't know about the rest of you but it will sure be a relief to see the lack of three digits in the days slot . As the clock winds down , I grow more and more flamboyant . YIPPEE ! ! ! ! PS ... another post , another screenie . ( i sure would like to know what those things flying through the air are ... )
