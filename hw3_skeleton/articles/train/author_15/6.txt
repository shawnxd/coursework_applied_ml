Hey all , just to clear up any mysteries , my song title today is by MCS ... who I love dearly now that I have had the chance to throughly listen to their album . They have some happy songs . I like it . I need some happy . Today is gon na be dubbed the official day of countdowns in my life . The countdown to the end of work . The countdown to school starting . The countdown to Halo 2 . The countdown to Fable ... . uuugh , I need sleep . I was up until 1:30ish last night talking to my favorite red of all time . No , I wo n't say I regret it , because this was n't the first time and it wo n't be the last . In fact , I happen to love talking to her . Actually , I 'll just go ahead and dedicate this post to her today . I know that none of you have a problem with that . If you do that 's just rotten poopie cookie dough for you is n't it ? I like cookie dough , but there 's a point , somewhere around where it becomes rotten/poopie , that I draw the line . I hope you will too . Or at least draw one some what sensible ? Please ? Thaaaanks ! ! ! PS ... I just checked out my hit counter waaaay at the bottom by my cool smiley guys and it says that 20 new people have visited in the last 4 days . I guess my message is out . w000000t ! ! ! ! ! ! ! `` ...
