I am so bored ! I have WAY too much time on my hands , esp . after a stressful/long weekend of ballet performances . And so here is my honest opinion of some of my teachers ... . Mrs. Hume : Is so cool . She helps bible quiz have a comfortable , fun but good atmosphere . We have such great fun in that class . Mr . Harmless : Is very good . Not just cuz i 'm more of a 'math ' person than say science , but he makes math , interesting , relevant , and we have lots of fun in class as well as being able to learn alot . Ms. Weibe : does n't get appreciated nearly enough , but is SOOOOO GOOD . She must be so stressed out , and our class certainly doesn ' t help , but she makes English interesting ( and that is a hard feat ! ) , we have fun , and really do learn a LOT ! Mr. Johns : I must say there have been times when I have thought him a little unfair ( when teaching BQ , making seating charts , and grading tests ) , but he is a good teacher and I am able to find history interesting enough . We do the craziest things in that class , and I have enough memories to last a lifetime ! But he manages ( somehow ) , to keep order and balance . Mrs. Leitke : Wow , spanish 3 . What a fun class ... . Anywho , she is a good teacher , southern accent , crazy laugh and all . Many crazy memorys from this class too ... Mr. Heim : Although I do n't completely understand him , I have a lot of respect for him and he does a good job of shutting up certain ( ahem ) guys who do n't know the meaning of `` be quiet ! '' Ms. Syr : Lots of fun in health/P.E . I 'm so glad we 're going to Love ' !
