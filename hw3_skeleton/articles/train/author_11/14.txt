Will I ever make it to the end of the year ? Sometimes I think not . I 'm sure the purpose of this is to get us to be motivated to end the year well , but ... . and honestly we all have those days when we do n't care . -about anything . This whole week has been an 'i-don't-care ' week . I do n't care what I look like , I do n't care what anyone thinks about me and I do n't care how I do in school . I know this is selfish and I really do care , just not right now . When my report card comes in , I will care . When my parets are upset with me , I will care . I just need to use that motivation to care NOW . ( not working ) . But just so you know that I do care about some things : I care about the school play . It has been alot of fun and I cared enough about it last night to spend a good ( long ) hour to rip stich-by-stich the tuck in a costume for the play , just so it would be long enough . I also care enough about the play to read through the entire series to get an idea about my character and the story , but also because it is a very good series . I wo n't say anything about memorizing my lines , but the bottom line is ( ha , ha ) that I DO care about something . So there is my motivation and I WILL make it through the rest of the school year ! ... .I hope .
