How can I say this in only 100 words ? This one 's hard Ms. Weibe ! Lets see . I would like to attend and graduate some college ( not sure yet -but not Purdue and not Bob Jones ! ) . My ideal job I think would be acting in a movie . It would obviously depend -on many things , but I think it would be very cool to get paid to do something that I love ! Also before I turn 30 , I would like to travel -alot . I would like to tour the British isles : England , Scotland , Ireland , all of it ! Of all the places in Europe , my first choice to visit would be Italy . Who can resist Italian food , the coliseum in Rome , the gondolas in Venice , and all the rest . I would also like to visit Paris , Sydney , Madrid , and Jerusalem . During my travels I would like to climb a mountain , explore in a castle , see all the biblical sights of Jeruralem , go skydiving , surfing and rock climbing . I would like to get married sometime , but of course that all depends on who comes along : ) .
