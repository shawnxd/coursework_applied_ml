When I hear a certain name an image pops in my mind . The name of a person brings up a face and an emotion concerning them , the name of an object usually brings up memories concerning it . So many names belong to certain objects and would not suit any other object . For example : I can not imagine a rose being called spinach , but on the other hand if I had grown up hearing a rose called 'spinach ' i would never want to call it a rose . Similarly we tend to grow to love or hate certain names of people depending on how a person by that name acts . I would never name a kid of mine 'Osama ' but 'Rebecca ' on the other hand , I find to be a beautiful name , just like the person to whom it belongs . We tend to think it 's all about a name , but in reality it is the object itself that influences our view of a name .
