Yes , today is the day opening night of Anne of Green Gables . ( Huzzah ! ) . And Yes , Ms. Wiebe this is part of my relaxation-ness before I have to get made-up and put on frilly dresses etc . . This whole experience ( my first ) has been a lot of fun and I 've gotten to know all my fellow actors more ... .than I ever cared to sometimes . : ) I know all of our tempers have been tested and the stress levels have hit the roof , but I think ( and pray ) that we 'll manage to pull it all together tonight . Good luck all ! Now here are some comments to my fellow cast ... .. Regina : yay ! It 's been alot of fun with you as my fellow student , and I am NOT dead gone on charlie sloane ( I win ) . Jordan : you do really well as Jane , smile ! Eve : You are such a good actoress ! Its been fun 'hating ' you . Bethany : I 'm sure you 're tired of hearing it but you do really well as Rachel Lynde . Do n't stress out ! Scott : good job as my teacher ( esp . w/ Prissy : ) ) . Luke : You 're so much fun and I 'll forgive you for putting leaves in my hair . -maybe . Sam : ha , ha . Do n't forget those multiplication tables ! Rebecca : It has been so divine doing the tea party scene with you ! Deborah : you are SUCH a good Diana . You do a good job of acting drunk ! : ) Rachel : I love your Aunt Josephine hobble . There are a lot more but 30 is too many to put everyone down , so I love you all , thanks to all the crews : you rock and also to all of you who came to see us : it would n't have been the same w/o you . Thanx
