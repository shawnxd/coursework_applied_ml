One of my first memories as a child was when we lived in our old house in Virginia . I had a favorite stuffed rabbit and I always used to hold her and suck on my two little fingers . I can still hear my mom called for me to see where I was and if I was sucking my fingers again . A very pretty sound that I can still hear is the sound of the ocean . The blue waves lapping on the shore while I swung in a hammock underneath two palm trees on a hot day in Cancun , Mexico . I can still hear the sounds of gray dolphins , I could even hear their friendly clicks while underwater . Its sounds like these that I wish I could recall on freezing days and wrap around me like a warm fuzzy blanket . But I love snow too . Actually the loudest sound that I remember is silence . I can still hear the silence one summer day when a car slammed into the side of our van . I ca n't recall a word said . Only silence . I also can still hear the silence in a small green car driving through Laffayette as my Mom announced to the family that Dad had cancer . I remember no words , just my mom 's brown eyes brimming over in tears .
