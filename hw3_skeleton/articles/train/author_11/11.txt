It 's almost eleven on Friday the ninth , and I 'm already bored ! One of those things where you spend all your time doing nothing and then wonder where the time went . Anyway I thought I 'd just share some of my random thoughts on Good Friday with y'all . Why is it called 'Good Friday ' ? Other than refering to the fact that we have no school ... . I would almost tend to think of it as being 'bad Friday ' because today is when we recognize Jesus ' death on the cross . Good ? not when you first think about it but-yes ! Because if today had never happened and I was sitting in Chemistry class like I would be on a normal Friday at this time , I would be doomed to live forever away from God ! The thought seems almost unreal . I sit here with all my comforts taking God 's grace for granted . I am so selfish ! I do n't even begin to deserve all that I have ! And God even grants my smallest wishes ! ( For example I really wanted to be in the school play . I prayed to God , and I have a fairly large part ! ) . And when sometimes it is not his will to grant my desires , I get upset ! ! ! God wants the best for my life and I have absolutely NO reason to get upset when things do n't go my way ! OK so thanx for staying there with me . I hope that Passion Play goes well ! Good luck , and sing well all my sophomore choir friends !
