A funny story Do you ever notice , if you are aimlessly walking down a grocery aisle , how many little kids there are ? Some kicking and screaming at their mommy and others completely lost , wandering around searching for their lost relatives ! Well , one day I was in Sam 's Club , while my parents were there . I was quite bored and was wondering around aimlessly , when something caught my eye . It was a lost little girl . She was walking around looking rather worried that mommy and daddy were no where to be found . Being bored , I decided to follow her and see where she went . She walked around and around and finally settled on going the the food court . She saw an old couple and decided to ask them if they 'd seem her parents . Well , they had n't , but invited her to join them in eating ice cream until her parents returned ( which they knew they would , as all parents know that children are drawn to food ) . So for quite some time the happy child continued eating her ice cream , almost forgetting that she even had parents , until they came and saw her . Where had she been ! They 'd look 'd all over for her ! And dispite the situation they found it rather amusing and often reminded that little girl , when she was growning up , of the time she 'got lost ' in Sam 's Club . I wonder who that girl was ? Oh wait ! it was me !
