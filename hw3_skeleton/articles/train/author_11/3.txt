Of the many wonderful times that I had as a child , I think that one of my favorite memories was of our woods . From about the ages of about 3 to 11 , I lived in a house out in West Lafayette where there was lots of woods . Most of my time after schoolwork was done was spent out side in the woods . It was a cheery wood . Not dark or gray , but full of sunlight , with a merry brook giggling it way through the woods . There were many beautiful flowers out there that covered the ground with their fresh scent , but also there was a peaceful calm where one could just wonder around and be happy . I remember days when I would be out so long , that i would get hungry and have a snack out there . All summer long the blackberries were juicy and delicious , there were pear and apple trees , and I would even eat the wild onions and mustard plant leafs ( which I used to eat all the time ! ) .
