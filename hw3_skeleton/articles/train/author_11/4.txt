If I could invent any holiday in the month of January , it would definately be on the Monday after the first weekend of January . It would be called National Sleep-in Day . On that day there would be no school so people could , well , sleep in ! That day would make the first week of school go a lot faster , as well as console those of us were extremely loathe to go return to school . I would especially appreciate this holiday because the first weekend of January I have three performances of The Nutcracker , not to mention a long week of rehearsals , and setting up and taking down the props , back drops and floors . After five days of five-hour rehearsals each day , three performances seem like nothing . Still , the energy it takes to go all the way through the ballet with out stopping , and of course still trying to look like ballet is the easiest thing in the world ( which it â€™ s not ! ) , when your legs , arms , and toes kill , is so exhausting that it is almost impossible to stay awake and paying attention to teachers early Monday morning .
