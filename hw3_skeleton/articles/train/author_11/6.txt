This is pretty hard ! I spent Wednesday and Thursday of break working eight hours shelling corn and other various jobs . Although it was kind of difficult to talk with ear plugs in I was able to talk to some people that I had worked with last summer and say goodbye to my friend Cory , a senior at Clinton Prairie , who right after graduating is going off to the Marines . I had some bonding time with two chicks both named Amanda , both juniors and Rossville . Both cheerleaders . Need we say more ? But it was nice to get to know them better . I also had some bonding time with Jared Layton who is also a junior at Rossville . Through him I learned some things about Faith kids that I did n't know before , and was able to invite him to the Bring 3 tournament in May . Friday I babysat for two girls that never ran out of energy even when I was pooped , but I was able to help out their family so that was good . So I suppose that I 'd say that my favorite memory over break was going shopping on Saturday . Pretty sad , huh ? Over all it was n't bad . Made some money . Talked to friends , studied Bible Quiz ( yeh ! ) , and slept ! ! ! ! ! ( a little ) .
