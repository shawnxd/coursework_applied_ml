Today was a great day ! The weather was warm and breezy , P. was away at a muster , G. was at Boy Scouts . I did three loads of laundry The dishes Clean , dusted , and vacuumed my entire office Got all my paperwork in order . I have now cut down on the Klonopin from 1mg to 0.5mg for one week . There have been difficult dreams/nightmares every night and I am not sure if it is related to the medication . I really have enjoyed a couple of months with no nightmares . I 'll keep trying a bit and see how it goes .
