Val , You were truly a good person . Your fellow teachers respected and liked you . You had a connection with your students that is not often seen . I am glad that your pain and suffering are gone , but without you there is one fewer light shining . I pray that God may allow you to support and guide your children as they grow . We were honored to know you and work with and I can only hope that somewhere in my soul a small part of you remains to give the strength and dignity you had . Thank you .
