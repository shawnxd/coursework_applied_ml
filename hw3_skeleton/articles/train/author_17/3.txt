Dementia . A word that seems medieval , and brings to mind images of ranting , violent murderous madmen . But I know that is not what it is . It is quiet and slow and creeps up on its victims until it has a hold of them , a hold so strong it will continue to vine its way through their mind and soul until it has choked everything that made them who they are out . Its insidious , showing its true self in time for its victims to know it has them and what it will do to them . Fear and anger overwhelm the victims , as they realize they are losing themselves to it . As the dementia wraps its coils tighter and tighter , the fear and anger are turned to those who care for its victims , making them victims as well as they watch their loved ones slowly suffocate in its grip . Eventually , a look into the eyes of the demented reveals not a lunatic , but an empty slate , wiped clean . Once in a while a little bit of who they were sneaks out , “ These flowers , they ’ re called butter and sugar flowers , they always grew in our yard when I was a child , ” “ I know I don ’ t get everything right , but I really try hard , ” “ Louise , they must have buried her here in her urn the way she wanted. ” Where do the souls of the victims go ? Does god have a special place for them ? Perhaps their souls drift among the living , helping them remember who they were . A sudden memory of being allowed to hide in the closet among the many old clothes that smelled so different and were from another era , a game of hopscotch with a Nana who has served as a surrogate grandmother for many years , a go cart built together , a love of animals instilled through the kindness shown to any stray . I pray that God has a special place for these souls until they may enter heaven , because he has left us their bodies to teach us patience and kindness and how to give them the dignity they deserve as we watch them slowly slip away .
