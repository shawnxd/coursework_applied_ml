Another good day ! We cleaned the garage , I cooked a unique dinner when our grill died . It came out pretty good . Leftovers tomorrow night . I also reconciled the checking accounts , one of the last items to do after the pocketbook theft . Last week I left my pocketbook in the back of my car for no more than three minutes in the middle of the day at a store with lots of people around and they smashed my window and took my purse . Would n't have been so bad if I had n't had my palm in it with SplashId on it with no password because I was still working on it . So even though I keep no money and no credit cards in there , I still had to change everything . Oh well . Live and learn . My uncle recently died and I wrote this thank you to him . Uncle , I would like to thank you for all the things you taught me : How to grow old gracefully and how to keep young by always trying new things . How to always be a gentleman ( woman ) even when dealing with those who were not nearly as polite . How to be kind and caring for the creatures God put on this earth as our companions , even when they might not be so gentle . How to realize that I was capable of doing anything I put my mind to , as long as I was willing to take a risk . How to tell a good story and how to listen to one told by a teller far less gifted . How to maintain your dignity even when you lose a good engine and everyone is saying “ I told you so ! ” How to share your home and life so others could enjoy them as much as you . How to love and teach children , no matter how many there were , even when none were “ yours . ”
