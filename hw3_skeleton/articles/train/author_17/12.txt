I just got back from watching I , Robot . It was fantastic ! The special effects were great , the actors fit the roles well and the storyline itself was great . It brought up a lot of issues for discussion-racism , what makes an individual an individual , do emotions equate to life , what does make humans human ? The kids thought it was great too . I would definitely this movie to anyone .
