Nights are always the difficult time . After having spent so many years as an insomniac and with the horrible nightmares when I did sleep , I am afraid to not fall asleep . I tried an experiment for the last three weeks by cutting the amount of Klonopin from 1mg to 1/2 mg , then to none . After three weeks not sleeping and having nightmares I gave up . When I went to see Dr. S. we decided we would cut the Paxil in half to 10 mg . So far no anxiety or panic attacks and I am still able to lay still ( since I never actually sat still until 4 years ago , this is an important thing for me . But even though my body is quiet , my mind is racing . After seeing how it felt to not be thinking and speaking at 78 RPM , it is hard to go back there . I am tempted to take extra Klonopin to help me sleep . I can not decide whether I want to see behind the door of my dreams ( nightmares . ) The door to the room which makes me wake up screaming in a cold sweat or wakes me with the idea there is someone in our bedroom . I think sometimes I would be better if I knew what was behind there , but then I wonder because the thought of the room is so terrifying . Even during the day thoughts of it make my stomach turn and my heartbeat faster . Lately my dreams have been about being captured by other people and/or other creatures that look like humans . I try to escape and wake up in a cold sweat . All I want to do is go to sleep and not remember any of what I dreamt , good or bad . The house , the room , the door Always on the second floor , often in the attic Once in the house I know it 's there Trying to avoid it , my path always leads to it . What is behind the door ? Some memory of unspeakable things done to me ? The knowledge of witnessing a terrible event ? An incident that only a small child would find terrifying , that the child within me still fears ? The house , the room , the door , Always on the second floor .
