Someone from Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Montreal called yesterday to screen me a bit . She informed me that a commitment to BB/BS often translates into mutliple years , at 3-4 hours a week . She also informed me that I might have to wait a while to get a partner because there is a much greater need for Big Brothers than there is for Big Sisters . The reason for this is that in order to be qualified to get a big brother or sister , you have to come from a single parent family . Usually there are more kids without fathers than there are without mothers . Anyway I told her I was still interested and the next step is an orientation meeting at their offices early in September . Yay !
