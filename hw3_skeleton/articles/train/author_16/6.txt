Shitty , I have a dentists ' appointment after work today . I 'd rather spend the 175 bucks on clothes or shoes or kittens or whatever but noooooooooo , apparently teeth need to be taken care of too . Stupid teeth . *** I hate the dentist . First of all , I am scared shitless of them . The sound of a drill just freaks me out . For a long time I avoided them like the plague , going only every few years to get the requisite cleaning or when things were hurting because we all know that when it hurts to eat chocolate , something has to give . *** The last time I went was last year , and that was because a filling fell out . I did n't have insurance so it cost me like 1.5 million dollars . I should have gone back after that , but knowing all of the other work I needed done I decided to put it off until I got a job with insurance . Now that I have a job with insurance , it 's time to milk that fucker dry . *** My insurance is so weird . I am covered for the silliest services . For instance , if I want to see a herbologist , I can . So I will . *** Insurance companies and the people who work for them are big time evil , almost more than pharmaceuticals even . You can tell that these two industries are like cousins and hang out together and drink beer and talk about how they scored over the weekend . Anyway . Wish me luck . I have $ 2000 to spend on my smile so when I go to Italy in May , I will knock those Italians out with my pearly whites . That way when I am sipping champagne in a gondola in Venice with a short skirt and strappy heels on , my smug smile of knowing how fabulous I am will be white and beautiful . Yay !
