I finally figured out how to get a pic in my profile , so check it out . Now you will know what I look like ! *** The pic was taken 2 years ago by this photographer named Norm Edwards who was working on a book called 200 Women , 200 Sheets . In exchange for a shoot , he gave the 200 women portfolios of sorts . I was one of them . *** If you go to his site ( urlLink www.normedwards.com ) you will see me and the other ladies he shot for this project . Good times . I felt like a model for a day .
