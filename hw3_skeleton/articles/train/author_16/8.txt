As some of you know I have had some pretty bad luck in the pet department . When I moved in , I had two cats . 4 months later I have zero ( one ran away and the other was graciously taken by my mother . ) When I moved in there was no pigeon problem , now there are 8 on my balcony doing nothing but shitting and fucking and laying more eggs . In other words I went from 2 cats and 0 pigeons to 8 pigeons and 0 cats in just inder two months , how do these things happen and why ? WHY ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Anyway . I waited a while to see if Simon would come back ( that was 2 months ago ) and he has n't . I loved him so much , he was my meow . We were a team . It was me and Simon against the world ! For a while I did n't think I could move on and get another cat . But now I see that living a meow-less existence sucks ass and I am on the market to adopt 1 or preferably 2 kittens . I would adopt a full grown cat except that I do n't want to . I want kittens in the house ! So drop a line at urlLink grrrl24 @ hotmail.com if you have or know anyone who has kittens to give away or sell . In exchange I will buy you 1 , maybe 2 beers and maybe a chocolate bar if you 're lucky and I 'm feeling generous .
