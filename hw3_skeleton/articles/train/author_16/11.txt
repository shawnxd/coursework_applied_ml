I had a weird dream the other night about someone I have n't seen in a few months and who I miss all the time named JD . He and I had a funny little relationship that revolved around sex mostly . I fell quickly and thoroughly in love with him but sadly , his heart stayed firmly on its feet . We subsequently tried to pursue a friendship that was doomed to fail before it ever really started . It has been my experience that when one person feels romantically inclined about the other , no matter how good his or her intentions , the frienship will not work out . Anyway ours failed despite my better efforts and I am still partially in love with him and miss him all the time because underneath it all , we were really good for one another . *** There were a few things about him that were so easy to love . For instance instead of saying no , he 'd make a `` tsk '' sound with his lips . It was so very very yummy when he did that ; I often asked him questions whose answers I knew were no , just to hear it . He was very calm and assured . He had an answer for everything . He was patient and understanding . He was temperate . He was nice . My fantasies about him often revolved around simple things like us cooking together . I had this one recurring fantasy where he would be at the stove making something and I would be tossing a salad at the table and we would be talking in the quiet tones of people who have had conversations like these a thousand times before and would continue to do so for a long , long time . *** When things ended I was very sad , and cried for a week . *** The thing is , I do n't cry . Only at movies , and even then it 's not a big deal . Usually whoever I 'm with does n't even notice . But when things ended with JD I was crying all the time . I kind of appreciated it about myself . It 's so human . *** Anyway I have n't heard from JD since and have not tried to make contact because as great as he was , JD was also a big fat jerk . Our friendship ended becuase he was taking advantage of the situation , which is intolerable . When I give you my heart , you had better treat it with care fucker or I will take it right back and I promise you wo n't have another chance . So I walked away . Actually here is the letter I wrote him : `` Dear JD , You made it clear some time ago that you did not want to pursue a romantic relationship with me , and this I accepted . However recently you made it equally clear that you do not want to pursue a friendship with me , and so I will smile the Mona Lisa smile of someone who has been thoroughly fucked and walk away before the shit house goes up in flames . Best of luck to you , Eve '' *** To which he responded : `` Dear Eve , I think you may have jumped to conclusions prematurely but if this is how you feel , I must respect that and your wishes . JD . '' *** Oh man . You could hear my heart breaking . *** For the longest time afterwards I waited for him to call . I would scan the cars outside my work for his , hoping he 'd have come to his senses , hoping that he loved me too , underneath it all . But it has been almost 3 months and that moment never came . *** I was almost over it . But then , just to make things interesting , my subconcious decided to throw in a hummer of a dream and now I am thinking about him all over again . In the dream he came by my place but I missed him . He had left a note . The note said that he missed me and that he loved me and that he was sorry . Just as I was reading it I started to wake up . And as I was waking up and realized that it was a dream , I started to hate myself for getting my hopes up , even if it was during a state of unconciousness . *** The moral of this post is that I am a big softie . *** No . The moral of this post is that love is awesome even if it is n't always pleasant , and it is better to have loved and lost than not loved at all . I guess .
