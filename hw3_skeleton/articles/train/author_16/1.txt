Welcome to my diary . It 's friday and I am 4 hours away from a 2 week vacation . I am going to Ottawa tonight for the weekend . I love Ottawa because the men are totally hot and the women are n't . When I travel there I feel like a supermodel , which is easy getting used to but really hard to come down from . Montreal is seething with women that are prettier than me , I come home and feel like a dirty old man . Last time I was in Ottawa I partied at this club called Helsinki . These guys with delusions of grandeur : 15 dollar cover ; requisite rolling of the eyes . But it turned out that there was this dj Max Graham there and the reason it was so bloody expensive to get in was because he is like local royalty on the club scene , people watch him spin and they swoon . All over the club were people glowing with love for this guy . Okay , the music was good but come on people get a grip . He 's not making you come from your ears or anything , god he was n't even wearing a cool shirt . Intrinsic difference between dancing in Montreal and dancing in Ottawa : In Montreal , you dance , you get a vibe , you shake everything you have , and then men will dance with you . It 's an appreciation thing . The better you dance , the better the odds that some dude will want to dance with you . And if you 're hot , forget about it , these guys are lining up . But in Ottawa , you dance , you shake everything your mama gave you , and the guys are appreciating with their eyes , but that 's it . And when you try to make eye contact with them , they avert . Almost in a panic . Anyway good times had by all except for one other thing : 4 dollar Evian . When you can drink a beer for less than you can drink water , there 's a serious problem .
