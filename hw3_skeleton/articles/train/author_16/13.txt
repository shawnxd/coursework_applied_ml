I want to take this opportunity to apologize to Pete for misquoting him in an earlier post about Jack Kerouac 's mom . I am still unsure what he really said verbatim , so I wo n't try to fix it . I 'd just make it worse if I tried , beleive me . All I want you all to know is that when Pete mentioned that had a man hit on his daughter , he was trying to imply that our conversation would have been a lot different . I will leave it at that . *** These posts often reflect my reality . Conversations that you read about in my blog really did take place and although I am not in the position to remember them word for word , I try to give you , the reader , the gist of what was said . I have not bothered to change any names because honestly , who reads this ? But since I do n't want to step on any more toes , I might just stop using names altogether . This way everyone has a sense of anonymity . *** Again , sorry Pete for misquoting you and giving your words the opportunity to be taken out of context . It wo n't happen again .
