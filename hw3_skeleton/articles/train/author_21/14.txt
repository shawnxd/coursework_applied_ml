I was listening to an old Offspring song called One Fine Day , where the guy talks about his perfect day . This song got me thinking about how my perfect day would go . However , I 'm gon na be realistic about this so I ca n't win the lottery and fly off somewhere tropical for my perfect day . So , if I had a perfect day , I would have it start this way ... Wake up , feeling refreshed and ready to go , with the sun shining through the window . Have a shower and not run out of hot water . Meet up with my friends and girlfriend and head down for breakfast at Honey 's Donuts . Then head down to the river , where it be just us and no one else there . Spend the day relaxing in the sun at the river and then head off with just my girlfriend for dinner somewhere . Then meet up with everyone and hang out and play pool and listen to music at my house for a few hours . After that we 'd go out somewhere or go to someone 's house and party . That 'd be a pretty sweet day for me . How would your perfect day go ? Cheers , Mick
