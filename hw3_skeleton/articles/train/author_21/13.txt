I 'm sitting on my computer at 5:34 PM , with nothing going on for me tonight , and for some strange reason I 'm not worried . Now , I 'm the type of person who gets bummed out when I do n't do anything but tonight I 'm totally fine with just chilling out and doing nothing . Sure , I 'll probably call up someone if I get bored , but right now its all good . I 'm missing out on probably what is going to be the best night of fireworks yet ( with the good weather and it being the final one ) , but its all good right now . Anyways , I 'm just thinking of stuff I could do tonight ... I 'll probably end up watching a few movies and sleeping ( which I could really go for tonight ) , maybe I 'll hang out with my little bro and watch the fireworks from the top of hill , not sure , maybe I 'll just right some more blogs , I 'll see how the night goes . Hope everyone out there has a good one . Cheers , Mick
