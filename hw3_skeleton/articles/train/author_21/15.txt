You know the ones I 'm talking about , those lazy boring summer days where you do n't feel like doing anything but you want to do something . Well , I 've had two in a row and I think I 'm gon na lose it if I have one more . So far this summer has been amazing , nothing boring , everythings been great , cept for one afternoon but the night was good . So yeah , you 're probably wondering whats the big deal about two boring summer days , I mean , summer is 70+ days anyways right ? So who cares if two of them sucked . Well , for me when I do n't do anything I feel like I 've wasted the day , and two days in a row , thats a lot time wasted . When I 'm bored I start to get really bummed out , and I also get a little grouchy , so do n't throw any F # $ % ing footballs at my house . Anyways , I do n't like being bummed out cause I think I bring my friends down when I 'm down , which makes me feel even worse . Tommorrow better be amazing cause the weekend is n't looking to great ( working both days ) , if tommorrow is n't great I think I 'm gon na blow a funny fuse and go bonkers . Bonkers is n't really a word used by most big kids , but it kinda fits , well , not really . To finish off my whiny blog , I hope you never have to go through boring days of summer . Cheers , Mick
