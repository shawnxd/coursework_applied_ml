I do n't really have anything to write about tonight so I 'm just going to fill you in with whats on my mind these days . Well , for starters last night was pretty fun , got stoned and watched Riverdance with Micheal Flattley , some crazy stuff . I also got to see a bunch of older people I used to play baseball with and hang out with way back in the day so that good . Anyways , what else happened that night ... I won some money playing cards and my girl got mad at me cause she thought I was making fun of her , which I guess I kinda was ( If you read this I 'm sorry ) , but yeah , its all good , funny stuff . One of my good buddies is back from Mexico so I got to see her today which was great and yeah , things are good right now . Went shopping with my bud today for birthday stuff , which went pretty well actually . I think guys are much better shoppers than girls , cause were more effiecient and we always come out with what we wanted to get . So yeah , that was kinda weird spending the afternoon shopping but yeah , it was actually kinda fun today . Cheers , Mick
