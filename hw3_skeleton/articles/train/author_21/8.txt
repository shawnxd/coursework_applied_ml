Well , today is the 11th of August and summer is half over . Back to school ads are popping up everywhere and the days are even getting shorters ( its dark out by ( 9:30 ) . So you 'd think with my favorite time of the whole year coming to an end I may be bummed out . Well , not this year , so far my summers been great and I 've done lots of fun stuff ( like learning to ride the bus , just joshing , that was n't really fun ) . I 've also got a feeling that the rest of the summer is gon na be awesome as well . Unfortunetly I 'm going away at the end of August cause I really wish I could spend the rest of summer with my friends and girlfriend , but hey , the OK is a fun place and I 'm sure it 'll be great . The driving lessons suck big time though , there super boring and we are pretty much just going through a book and watching really really lame videos , pretty crappy eh . But those lessons are only six hours outta the whole week . Also I 'm subbing down at the pool so it looks like the next six days are gon na be pretty busy . Which does n't really bother me cause the moneys great and I love being busy , although a relaxing night or day every now and then is great as well ( as long as its fun ) . A lot of people are coming and going these days and its kinda been hard to keep in touch with all the people I would have liked to keep in touch , I 'm not too worried about this because I 've seen lots of my best buddies all summer . Just got ta get some more alone time with my girl and then lifes pretty much perfect for me . Yeah , this has been a great summer so far and the next half of it should be just as great . Hope everyones summers been great . Cheers , Mick
