I 'd like to think I 'm good at reading people and determing what type of mood there in , so usually I can tell if someones in a playful , happy , sad , frusturated , or angry mood . Well , anyways , tonight someone I really care about seemed to be in a sad/angry mood , anyways , usually with people I care about I assume that it somehow was caused by me in some way or another , espically if they do n't come out and tell me whats up . So , I think I did something wrong and I 'm not sure what , but I 've got a few ideas kicking around . Now , its probably no biggie , and I 'm probably just overeacting but I get really worried when stuff like this happens and I 'm not sure why . Maybe its that I 'm afraid of losing that person or maybe its just that I read into things way to much ( maybe I 'm becoming more of a girl ) . Anyways , thats all I have to say , I think more about it and maybe it will all make sense in the morning . Cheers , I guess , Mick
