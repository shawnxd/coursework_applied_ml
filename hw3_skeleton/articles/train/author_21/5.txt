Now , I 'm a pretty paranoid guy to begin but when I get tired or bummed out then I get super paranoid , so naturally I hate secrets . Usually I go over and its all like `` Do n't worry , were not talking about you . '' But if your not talking about me why do you stop talking when I walk over and start laughing ? Interesting ... Anyways , I do n't really like secrets , and I do n't really get mad when people talk about them , I just think if your going to talk about people without them knowing just do it were no one can hear or see you whispering stuff . I just kinda went over my blog a second ago and I think I 'm too paranoid , the secrets thing is n't a big deal it just kinda bothers me sometimes . However , not everythings bad these days , I had a pretty amazing weekend ( other than work ) , and today is my girls 17th birthday , so things are looking good . Unfortunetly I got to work all day tommorrow and I 've got driving lessons tonight and another night this week . The weather is good though , and the river would be pretty sweet today so I think I 'll head down there . Cheers , Mick
