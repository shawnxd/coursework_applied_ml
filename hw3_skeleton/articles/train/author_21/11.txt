Lately I 've been thinking that maybe there are some things I should be doing that I 'm not doing right now and that maybe I 've made some wrong or stupid decesions that have got me in trouble . Should I think stuff through more ? To be honest I ferget about stuff that I do n't feel is a huge deal , however , what may be nothing to me could be a big deal to someone else , so I think i should think stuff through more and maybe do less stuff for me . I do n't really wan na be everything to everyone and have to be more restricted on what I can do and say but I 'm thinking it may be a good idea . I do n't and I wo n't change how I think and how I feel to try and please everyone but it really gets me down when I piss people off or even if I think I pissed someone off . Maybe I care too much ? But then again , maybe I do n't . I do n't think I should worry about it and maybe everything will seem clearer and simpler in the morning after work . Cheers , Mick
