Well , now that I 've actually been stoned I have to say that weed is pretty good . I love the feeling of being drunk because you get both a physical and mental effect . Whereas I think weed is just mental , because when you focus really hard you can do things normally , except tie a tie . Tonight would be the second time I have actually been stoned and it was really fun . We hit out of a bong , which was a first for me and we even had ice cubes and all that in the bong . Weed is cheaper than beer but I think I may like being drunk better just because I cough with feed and my breathe gets pretty bad . You do feel really comfortable when your stoned though , its like your sitting by an open fire , the warmth tingling feeling all over your body , its a good feeling . Then your body feels really heavy and you sink into the couch . Anyways , we watched Riverdance with Michael Flattley and it was pretty good . Its been fun . Cheers , Mick
