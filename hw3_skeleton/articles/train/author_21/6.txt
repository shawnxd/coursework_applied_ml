So far today has been one of those days , the days you wish you could just erase or do over . I had to leave my girlfriends house early last night so that I could wake up and be at work 6:15 , but today , when I got there they told me there was a schedule change so they did n't need me till 8:30 . So I walked home and tried to get back to sleep , but I could n't because of these really annoying birds , so when I walked back down to work I was feeling pretty pissed off . Lessons went well but the public swim was brutal , lots of young kids who could n't swim and really really really stupid parents letting the kids do really stupid things . I stayed an extra hour ( till 3:30 ) because the public swim was so bad . Anyways , then I went for drive and got home and slept , now I 'm about to head over to my girlfriends house for her party . Unfortunetly I probably have work tommorrow at 7:45 so its going to be another early night , which sucks . In other news a sorta bad ending spoiled what would have been an amazing night , it still was a great night , but the ending was n't that great . Anyways , time to have fun and hopefully change my day around . Cheers , Mick
