i 'm afraid ... afraid for me , i 'm afraid for others ... i do n't wan na die but i kno that i will never reach old age ... .there is something sad and exciting about that ... so that leaves me with little time to experience a full life ... 'cause u never kno when the final bomb is gon na drop ... the only thing that i 'm really afraid of is the pain ... does it hurt to die ? i supposed so ... and what am i to do if when the final bomb drops am i gon na have children already ? if i do what am i going to do about them ... i do n't want to see my children in pain ... if i knew that the world was ending ( for sure ) years before the bomb dropped would i be selfish enough to bring them into the world knowing full well that they will never grow old and live full lives ... i hope to god that i do n't ... but what if i got pregnant by mistake or some fault not known to me ... would i keep that child ? the thing is i do n't believe in abortion so i think that i would keep those children or child and let them lead as full lives as they could before time is up . so if it came down to me live and they die ... .i would give it all up for them..i would give my life for them ... i do n't wan na die .
