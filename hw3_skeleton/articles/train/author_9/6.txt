My life sucks ... .. Today like any other day was a crude example of my lack of any ability or talent in anything . That makes me sad ... what am i going to do with my life if i am good at nothing ? i am an utter failer in anything that involves numbers , or measurements . I am offically failing guitar , math , and possibly science . err ... . If only i could live in a world without numbers ... . Ah , a girl can dream ca n't she ?
