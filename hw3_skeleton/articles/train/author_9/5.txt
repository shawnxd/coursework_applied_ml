In my dreams , i live in a place , free from war and famine , death and disease . A place where people do n't kill people . Where nuclear war is not an imposing threat . And terrorist attacks are a thing of the past . the world i want does n't exist and never will as long as man kind stays on the path set before our feet at the begining of time.If we can change the fate of the world we not only save ourselves but also the millions of species of animals and organisms that had no part in the world 's destruction and were only innocent by standers to our greed . what can we do to save our world ? i really ca n't tell you but i kno i need to find it soon or my life and others will but cut short , it is unfortunate that most of my generation will not make it to their 50th birthday ... for the end is near my friends . and it is all our fault ...
