TV was once the centre of pop culture but no more it has been replaced by more popular and more excessable means : the internet . But i as with many others prefer t.v it is fun , cheap , and educational/entertaining ... . recently my faith has been restored in my beloved tv by programes such as theOC and the ever funny American Chopper ... I love Tv and blondes
