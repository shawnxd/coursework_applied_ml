hi today i am happy ... . the Calgary Flames lost ... although i am a canadian and my friends were all rooting for them i did n't want them to win..i hate hockey . And ( from my experience ) all hockey players are violent bafoons that enjoy getting their teeth knocked out of their heads by long sticks.See not all canadians like hockey . The stupid elections are coming up ... my thoughts.. president- John Kerry , Prime Minister- dunno ... but the conservative/ alliance party will get more seats in parliment then in former years cause of Steven Harper ... . I like blondes ...
