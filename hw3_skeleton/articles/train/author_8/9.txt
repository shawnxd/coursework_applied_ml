Next DBSA meeting will be in Valparaiso on Wednesday May 19th 6-8pm This meeting will be at Porter-Starke Services at 601 Wall St . It will be a rap session where anyone who wants to share is given a chance to . We always learn so much at these meetings and can ask questions of those who have been there . We hope to see you there . With summer almost here and so many kids home from college for the summer we at DBSA NWIN were wondering if there was a need and an interest in a separate support group for the younger consumers . Teens to young adult . At the present group everyone is welcome and we do have a wide variation of ages . Let 's face it though , teens are a group unto themselves . If they are bipolar or suffer depression they have questions and situations all of there own that they would like information on . Such as dating , school , life after school , suicide , meds and their effects on your body . I am sure many teens and young adults think they are alone in this illness , but it is amazing how many others there are out there with the same problems , just no one to share them with . So if you are a teen or know a teen that you think would be interested , let us know at DBSA NWIN and we will get started on a group just for you . You can contact us directly by clicking on the link to the National DBSAlliance and go to Indiana support groups , you will see us there . Also feel free to click on comments under this entry and tell us what you think of this idea . It is confidential so do n't be afraid to be honest . We hope to hear from you and see you on Wednesday the 19th .
