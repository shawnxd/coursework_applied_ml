Meeting Reminder DBSA Speaker Meeting Wednesday May 5,2004 601 Wall St. Valparaiso , IN Pam Arnold will be our guest speaker . Her topic will be the Importance of Communication . I hope you all will be able to join us at the meeting , but I know sometimes it is impossible with kids and other commitments . I will be posting the notes from Pam Arnold 's discussion on Thursday so you can read what you missed . Mark your calender for the meeting on May 19th . This will be our usual rap session . This is always a lively discussion about family , medications and general health issues . It is a time for us all to get the support we need and to share our knowledge to help others know that they are not alone . Be sure to join the group in Merrilllville on May 10th and 24th . The Monday night meetings there are from 7-9pm . Methodist Hospital Southlake Campus 8701 Broadway I realize there are a lot of parents in the Crown Point area that would like to have more discussion and information available on bipolar children at the Merrillville meetings . If you come to those meetings please convey that interest and we will continue to provide more support for the parents there . It is a great oppertunity to meet eachother and discuss the school situations and parenting issues . It is also a chance to make a connection with others in your area . Parents with a child just like yours that you did n't know was your neighbor .
