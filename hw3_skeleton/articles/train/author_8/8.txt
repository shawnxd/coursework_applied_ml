Meeting Reminder Next meeting will be in Merrillville on May 24th . In Merrillville the group meets at 7pm at Methodist Hospital 's Southlake Campus . Last night was our meeting in Valparaiso . It was a good group with a lively discussion . There was interest conveyed in a group for the younger consumers . I think beginning just before the teen years and continuing into adulthood . I am proposing the second and fourth Tuesday of the month at Porter-Starke . I would love to have the teens be instrumental in setting up this group . I also want them to feel free to discuss whatever is on their minds in an open setting of their peers . Everything they say in that room will remain confidential . Many of us wish there had been a group like this when we were teenagers . I hope all the teens will spread the word and this can become a group you will enjoy spending time at . Keep an eye on this site for further information .
