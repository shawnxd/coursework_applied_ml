I am proud to announce the formation of an additional support group in Porter county . After much discussion , for many years , we have finally done it . This group will be a peer to peer group to support teens and young adults . We still want them to attend the Wednesday meetings in Valparaiso and the Monday meetings in Merrillville because we need them there to set us straight on how things really are for them . Those meetings will still be open to the public and include everyone from families with children to adults and caregivers . The new group is of course open to the public also , but we will be discussing things that are relevant to teens and young adults . We also want to include the bipolar/mood disorder adolescent , beginning at age 10 , because as we all know , they are already wise beyond their years . We want young people to feel free to discuss what is important to them and to meet others that have similar problems . We will look forward to seeing you there . Please tell your friends and families about this group . Help spread the word . See you on June 8th for our first meeting .
