dead at the beginning i am waiting for the nothing that will happen i am staring at a screen on which responses never show i am clinging to a vision that is nothing but just that and i am sadly still perpetually alone would you love me if me if i died ? it is tempting to find out i can unearth it 's almost worth it to be sure without a doubt you see the saddest thing of all , my dear the things we 've said , the meaning clear mean not a thing to you , it 's true i 've cried my insides out from fear if i was gone i could move on and feel the earthly love i miss the things i crave and dodge for fear i 'll never gain another kiss
