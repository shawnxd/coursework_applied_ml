an ideal gent one , two , three , four times i hurried back for more you charmed me from top to the depth of my core oh dear do n't you know that i know i 'm a bore ? step up to the plate , you 're the last hopeful batter whether you score is the one truthful matter take you my heart , from the depths of this platter why should you care as you watch it all shatter ? four score and infinite days since we 've spoken two candid hearts but just one that is broken you 'll see that i 've left an invisible token forgotten and sad on the bed , you were joking for every stab wound that has sunk into bliss another rememberance calls of your kiss silently dropped in an unfeigned abyss surely they 'll notice that things are amiss ? a stereotype of the lost love avenger putting myself in the utmost of danger risking it for not much more than a stranger a childlike mistake as i layed in the manger how can my life be reduced to this fact my whole world rotated from one painful act to you it is nothing , you 've made it clear that what you lack in compassion you lack more in tact all that i want is to want nothing more than my calm crimson locks and an old four by four to bypass these nights , and these long days of lore please do n't even wave as you 're slamming my door without even talking you slowly torment i try to be kind but my patience is bent the sadness i gave and esteem that you lent are all i have left of the last ideal gent
