common anguish you met me then you let me fall in love . you bruised me then you used me without guidance from above . you waste me then you taste me from the corners of my heart . you lost me and you cost me all the trouble that i start . it 's all my fault , the things i said i 'm sorry i 'm so kind i nicely made your bed , and then i slit my wrists in mine . you combed your perfect hair and laid a flower on my head you sat me in your favorite chair an honor for the dead you brought her up , and stripped her off on top of my fine floor you slowly turned the music off the kind you mocked me for i 'm happy in this special place but not the one you think i love to watch your saddened face so have another drink
