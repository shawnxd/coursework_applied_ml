hate i know you want to just forget , oh that my dear , i will not let . the pain ensued since you let me get you , and now i never will forget you . as soon as the deed was good and done , you threw me out into the street . a little strange , but hey , it 's complete . why is it in secret that we always had to meet ? do n't you think it 's strange we had to make it so discreet ? why should n't i have yelled to the world , there 's finally one to make me his girl ! i should have stood in the rain and twirled . and danced and pranced 'til i made it sink in . i thought for once i might just win . but i lost again , i did , you did . i tried to make it up to you , you ran and then you hid . and now you 're nowhere to be found , i frown . but every time you 're near , i fear . i wish that you would disappear , i hate you . i 'm always indecisive but this time i am for sure . the only way to save me is substitute the cure . i need to be away from you , i need to find another new , i hate to say you got me but i hate you .
