my last alarm i cut myself today as if perhaps to say `` i 'll never like the weather and the pain is here to stay '' i sat down on my bed `` i 've lost again '' i said i sighed and then i cried and watched my sheets soak up the red my wound began to bleed i wonder `` what is it i need ? '' and tomorrow all the sorrow will imprint upon my sleeve i cover it and calm `` i 've really done no harm '' i slow my pace and wipe my face please disregard my last alarm .
