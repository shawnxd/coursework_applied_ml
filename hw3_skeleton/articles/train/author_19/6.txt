1 year today a year it 's been already , it seems . happy anniversary dear . have a drink or maybe lots more , and pretend none of this ever happened . not that i would expect in this lifetime or any others for you to recall the significance of this fatal date . i just sit here by myself and for once allow myself to remember . remember the memories and cherish them even though they do not deserve the cuts and scars i have forever etched into me from what you did to me . it 's good sometimes to just think of things when you need them . things that you would n't even know you needed until someone came along to change you , and change the way you see everything , from continents to clarification of self , to how the world gos around without falling . it 's not right for me to now not know how i lived before you . and it 's so hard when you see the one who enlightened you fall to the ruin of their own teachings . it 's hard to believe that such a change could come about in a small amount of time . three hundred and sixty degrees of worthless criticisms that you can now shout back at yourself . it was bad enough once , but how many times did this happen ? countless . i knew how wrong it all was but spontaneous desires have been awakened and are unsupressable . it 's more of a habit really , that i even recall your name . you should have been forgotten long ago , as i 'm nearly forgotten from your endless array of companions . you see , your massive ensemble can afford to be one short . many more in fact . but in my close circle of acquaintance , there is a clear hole where you used to sit so comfortably , and no substance can fill it , though i have experimented with them all . happy anniversary dear , would n't have missed it for the world .
