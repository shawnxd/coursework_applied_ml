today i was cleaning out my car , and the broken chicky wing was sucked into the belly of the vacuum . afterwards , the remainder of the chicky was seen by my friend Brandy . she asked me , `` What is your sister trying to say by naming this chicken after you ? It has a hair whorl on its butt . '' and thus ends the saga of the chicky . i 've noticed that , thus far , i have n't written anything real on this blog . you see , my natural state of being is serious . but sometimes i 'm too much so , even for me .
