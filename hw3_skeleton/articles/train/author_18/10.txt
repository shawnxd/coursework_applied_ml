typically , i think of myself as very money-conscious . but today , it suddenly occurred to me that i treat food as if it were free . i justify any amount of expense as long as it is being spent on something edible , which , if you think about it , makes very little sense . food can not be kept , because , by definition , it must be consumed . therefore no matter how much I buy , I will always and forever have to buy more and , thus , it is a most worthless investment . but none of that matters when you 're hungry .
