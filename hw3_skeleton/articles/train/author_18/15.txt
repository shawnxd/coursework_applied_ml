So , last night i began a blog . this morning i woke up and was struck , blindsided if you will , by a random memory . Provo , Utah . Last summer . Pioneer Day . the street was deserted . not even the proverbial turtle crossing the road . i was alone , under a tree , next to a bus stop , waiting ( surprise ) for a bus . i had been waiting for half an hour , having ( or so i assumed ) barely missed the last bus . i looked at my watch . `` seems a little later than usual , '' was the naive supposition . and then , it came to me . `` It 's PIONEER DAY ! '' I screamed ( literally ) at the empty street . And as I started WALKING to work ( a good hour away ) all I could think was , `` It 's not even a REAL holiday . '' It 's NOT a REAL holiday , people . Honestly , Provo . -- -- - alexa composed a haiku on the topic : here i am alone where have all the buses gone ? it 's pioneer day !
