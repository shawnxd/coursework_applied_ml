Yesterday I met a boy named Jayson . Jay-son , as opposed to just ... Jason . Right . In other breaking news : the wing has now fallen OFF the chicky , thus extending the metaphor , and my sister eats avocado halves as if they were pudding cups . Joy : You 're scooping the avocado straight into your mouth . Alexa : Yes Joy : But.. Alexa : ( cutting Joy short ) They were MADE to be eaten this way . Look , it forms its own bowl . ( She spoons more avocado into her mouth ) See ? Joy : ( enlightened ) Ah .
