teach for america pre-institute starts tomorrow . on june 9th , i cease to own my own life . sometimes i look in the mirror and ask myself how it is that i came to be 22 -- 22 and preparing to teach school , high school . HIGH SCHOOL , when I myself look like a high school student . my friends have one , consistent reaction when i tell them i 'm going to teach high school . random friend : so what are you up to ? Joy : I 'm doing Teach for America . I 'm going to teach high school ESL . random friend : High school ? Joy : Yeah . random friend : ( always a pause ) ... But ... you 're ... you 're so ( searching for the right word ) ... small . i 'm about 5 ' ; i will not divulge my weight . i think that there are plenty of women who measure in at that height , but there seems to be something about me that screams `` Small Woman Approaching ! '' Personally , I think it 's everyone else that 's too large . Honestly , what a waste of space . : )
