in my little sister 's car , there is a chicky , aka a small wire and fuzz toy bird of a chicken-like persuasion . she has named the chicky `` joy . '' the chicky is continuously thrown from its perch on the dashboard from the momentum of the car turning this way and that as the oh-so-powerful toyota corolla careens crazily about the little German hamlet of Klein , Texas . the last time I ( aka `` the chicky '' ) was thrown from the dashboard , one of Alexa 's friends stepped squarely on me . Alexa : ( screams ) AhIEEEAHiEEiEEE ! ! ! ! her friend : What ? ! What ? ! Alexa : You STEPPED on JOY ! her friend : ( baffled ) What ? `` My '' right wing is now crushed and dangling from my poor , wizened body . It 's a metaphor for my current life . Joy : When will I be better , Alexa ? Alexa : ( sagely ) When your wing is glued back on , Joy . Ca n't touch our depth .
