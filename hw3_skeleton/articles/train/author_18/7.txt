Today was the first offical day of TFA 's five week summer institute . It has begun , and it is both brilliant and stressful . I know saying `` brilliant and stressful '' is a vague description at best , but I find there is more than I can say , despite the fact that things have only just begun . For now , I will say nothing relevant . I give you the following random event . I 'm driving down Kirby with my new TFA roommates . One of them , Holly , points out a sign . She says , `` Hey look . It says 'Free Gas with an Order of Beans ! ' '' We all snicker .
