Dear Reader ( s ) , I know that readers of this blog are few and far between . In fact , I know that readerS might very well be only readeR , with that reader being Alexa , my little sister . However , fantasy is my forte , and so ... Dear Reader ( s ) , At 5pm today , I walked back into my dingy , Moody Towers dorm room . All Teach For America Corp Members had been up and about since 6am , at the latest . I came in and took out a box of Triscuits . My roommate came in and touched her laundry . It was still wet . She started to cry . I casually ate my cracker and asked , `` What 's wrong ? '' You may be asking yourself why I was so cold . My answer ? The thing about TFA institute is that you already know why he/she is crying . You 're almost there yourself . Katie Muto , my roommate , wants to know if `` it 's in her '' to do the work we have to do -- to teach students in low-income communitites , to close the educational achievement gap . `` Of course it 's in you , Katie . '' `` No , IS it REALLY ? I ca n't just sail through this . '' No , she ca n't . She has to do well , because teaching matters too much to do otherwise . We talked through the tears ; she left for a drive . And now , I 'm left thinking of the nature of this oft heard phrase , `` Is it in me ? '' It 's as if we all believe that there is a cap on our individual potential ( s ) or that we believe we have been pretending all this time and someone will inevitably find us out , that we are about to be found out . That we are not enough . I think that 's the real question . Are we enough ? `` Is it in me ? '' can be a complicated question . But the root question , `` Am I enough ? '' is simple . And the answer should always be Yes .
