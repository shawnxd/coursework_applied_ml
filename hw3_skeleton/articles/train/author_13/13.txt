i may never c tomorrow ; there 's no written guarantee n things that happened yesterday belong to history i can not predict the future , i can not change the past i hav just the present moment , i must treat it as my last i must use this moment wisely for it soon will pass away n b lost forever , as part of yesterday i must exercise compassion , help the fallen to their feet b a friend unto the friendless , make n empty life complete the unkind things i do today may never b undone n the friendships that i fail to win may nevermore b won i may not hav another chance on bended knees to pray n i thank God wth a humble heart 4 givin me this day urs truly , me
