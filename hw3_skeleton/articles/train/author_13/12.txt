do u know sumthing ? i dont really know anything but heck , one thing we do know 4 sure is that we instinctively fear pain ... in my experience , i try 2 avoid all pain whether physical or emotional n mental as well.. hav i not buried my pain deep within as if they 're never there ? this state of anesthesia has pervaded my soul til i begin to panic when there 's nothin or nobody left 2 distract me.. when i hav no project 2 finish , no friend 2 visit , no book 2 read , no television 2 watch , no cd 2 play , n when i 'm left all alone by myself , i 'm brought so close 2 the revelation of our basic human aloneness ... i 'm scared as heck of experiencing an all-pervasive sense of loneliness that i 'll do anythin 2 get busy again n continue the rat race that comforts me 2 blieve that everythin is fine after all ... n so , like the Energizer bunny , i just keep goin n goin n goin , but even the bunny cant go on 4ever , mayb a littl longer than its competitors , but definitely not 4ever..sooner or later it has 2 stop , just as sooner or later u n i hav 2 stop ... urs truly , me = )
