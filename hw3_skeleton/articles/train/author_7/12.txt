Ok so this one is pretty nasty . Not like nasty as in preverted nasty . But ok. Ok so there were 4 guys standing outside a bar . So one guy walks into the bar and asks the bartender for a straw . He gives the man a straw and the man walks out . So the second guy walks in , also asking for a straw . He gives the man a straw and the man walks out . Then the third guy walks in and asks for the bartender for a straw . He gives the man a straw and the man walks out . Ok so now the bartender is really wondering why everyone wants a straw . Then the last man walks in . Unlike the others , he asks for a toothpick . The bartender says `` Why do you want a toothpick ? All the other guys wanted straws . '' The man answers him by saying `` Some guy puked outside and now all that 's left is the chunks they drank all the good stuff ! ''
