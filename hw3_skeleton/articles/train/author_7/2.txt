Ok I just tried to make some mac and cheese for lunch right . Ok so I boiled the water . Then I put the noodles in and started boiling them . And then guess what I noticed floating around in my lunch ... BUGS ! ! ! 6 or 7 or them ! ! ! In my macaroni ! ! ! Well I obviously did n't have mac and cheese for lunch . Cold pizza and chocolate pudding is so much better anywayz ! Well TTUL !
