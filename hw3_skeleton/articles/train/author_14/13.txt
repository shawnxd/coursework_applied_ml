Man , I just found some of my poetry that 's still up at my geocities site ( via the wonders of google ) . I need to get my poetry collection back up on laurensworld , but I 've not had the time , desire , or net access at home to do so . Want to read what 's out there now ? Go for it . urlLink Here you 'll find an older piece that I featured after taking down my poetry collection ( entitled kaleidoscope ) in a moment of absurdity . urlLink Here 's some more recent stuff ( about a year old ) . Just a little taste to show you another dimension . I 'll try to get all of kaleidoscope back up soon , if anyone is still interested ; )
