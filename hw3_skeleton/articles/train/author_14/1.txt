I was looking for an email in my inbox , and I found some pictures of Jack that I have on my phone and had emailed to myself . He is SO adorable ! I need to take some new pics -- this one is a couple months old . As he 's gotten bigger , his markings have become much more distinct . Perhaps I 'll have more to share soon . For now , enjoy !
