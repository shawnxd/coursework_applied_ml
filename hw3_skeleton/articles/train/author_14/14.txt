That 's the title for my most recent ( and I believe , greatest ) painting . None of my other pieces have titles , so perhaps that is why I am so amazed by the painting . And what 's even cooler is that the name came *while* I was painting . For the non-Tool fans out there , the title is from a Tool song ( Lateralus ) . I should take some pictures of my paintings and post them . Make no mistake -- I 'm no Van Gogh . All my stuff is pretty abstract . However , I 've only been painting for about a month , so I 'm pretty pleased with my results as of yet . Being in a technical field , I really like having artistic outlets . Not just creative but artistic outlets , as computer science has the potential to be wildly creative , despite what some may think . Of course , I do n't get that many creative ventures at work right now , but I hope that changes . Until I can post more about my inner Picasso , keep fighting the power .
