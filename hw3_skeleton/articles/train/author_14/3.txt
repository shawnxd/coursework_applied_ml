I saw it on Friday , and I 'd like to post more about it soon ... but for now , I just have to make the public service announcement -- go see this movie . Sure , it 's biased . But it 's a bias that has not been presented yet . And I 'm all about the drummer who takes to his own beat , Thoreau-style . Until I can post more , fight the system .
