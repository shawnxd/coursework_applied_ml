It sucks . Day 3 , and I 'm already scrapping it . For the past 3 days , I have had a headache , been tired , and been obsessed with food . I learned some great lessons from it about watching what I eat and limiting bad carbs , but my body told me that something was wrong . So , now I 'm enjoying a smoothie and getting some energy . Yaay ! The good thing is , now I 'm motivated to work out more . Kinda hard to work out when you have ZERO energy . Lots more to say , but no time right now to say it . Until later ... stay away from any diet that prohibits fruit !
