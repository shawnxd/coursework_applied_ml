Well , I have many things to ponder and discuss , but I still ca n't bring myself to post my most pressing ( and intimate ) thoughts on this blog . Why ? Vulnerability . Exposure . Humiliation . And the like . I used to encode such thoughts in poetry , so that 's something to consider . Perhaps I will take a different angle and start writing ficitonal stories through which I can convey the same emotions and thoughts ... but that sounds like a considerable amount of work when I could just write in my MacJournal or one of my paper journals . Although I suppose part of the reason for posting an entry to this blog is to get feedback/comments/whatever ... another reason is simply to share , though ... to release whatever it is that is weighing on me so that I can ... Hmm . So that I can what ? What the hell is the point ?
