Okay , so here 's the big thing I realized ... work is not for me . Come on , Lauren , you say , we all have to work . Sure , but does it have to suck so badly ? I 've been thinking a lot lately about my life ... my career ... and , let 's face it , I do n't want my job to be such a JOB . So I 've come to the epiphany that is driving me to return to school a helluva lot sooner than I 'd imagined . Sure , I figured I would go to grad school in say , 3-5 years . But the catalyst of boredom is pushing up my turntable . I mean , one of the happiest people I know in the world is a Professor . The man LOVES what he does ... he LOVES his job , his wife , his kids , his life . He is just generally happy and totally stoked about what he does . And that 's what I want . I want to love my life . I want to be intellectually stimulated with my work . I want to solve the problems that have no solution . I want to attack the issues that may not be resolvable . I want ... the hell out of this cubicle , the metaphor for the job that restricts my thoughts to a confined space ... Now , I 'd better get back to work . Joy .
