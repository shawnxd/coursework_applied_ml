I found this old zip disk when I moved , and I 've been meaning to bring it in to work because I do n't have a zip drive at home . So , I brought it in today , and it 's got laurensworld.com from 1999 ! Now , that was back in the day when the site was filled with content , and it had some badass graphics . Check out this graphic that was on the first page of the site ... I 'm still proud of it to this day . If only I had n't lost the original Photoshop in an unfortunate disk drive death ... But oh well , that 's life . Check out some old skooL laurensworld , and I 'll be sure to post more later . I 've got to get this stuff off of the zip disk so I can sort through it tonight/this week . The original was too wide ( it screwed up my blogger layout ) , so I posted a thumbnail that links to the original . Enjoy ! urlLink
