I just read a great book , tuesdays with Morrie It was amazing ! I spent my entire morning just reading it . It made me cry , and rethink a lot of stuff in my life ... Soccer tonight ... I 'm excited ... I hope our winning streak holds out ... if not , I 'll be kinda cranky , since I 'm sacrificing a lot of time on soccer this season ... .almost every day ! Love , Keely
