I felt sick this morning so I did n't go to soccer practice ... .my knee really hurts from last night 's game . Feeling sick and tired and sorry for myself , but I 'll pick it up . I could n't sleep last night either ... stayed up until 5 AM for some reason . Hopefully I 'll shake off this weird feeling ... I hope I 'm not getting sick . Today , I sent out a Father 's Day card to my dad ... it felt weird addressing it to a Correction 's Facility ... sad . Then my sister , Leah , took me to the mall with her baby . I love those two ! ! Well ... .I guess I should go make something of my day , rather then sit on-line feeling sorry for myself ! ! LOVE , Keely
