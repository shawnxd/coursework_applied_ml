Last night was pretty awesome ! I hung out with Grethell and Britt and it was fun . I slept at Grethell 's and Neil and Cody stopped by . It was pretty fun , I must say , except for some of it , lol , but I bet that it 's those times that I 'll remember ... .I 'm making memories ! ! Tonight I 'm hanging out with Leah Rogotzke , too . Love , Keely
