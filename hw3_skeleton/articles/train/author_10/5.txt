These are the lyrics to `` Last Summer '' and they make me sorta sad ... I miss last summer ... this one is good , too ... but it can never be the same . The Friday sun bears down again As we drive without friends And on these longest days we spend All the time trying to pretend That our stories could be true Our chance to be cool The setting down says the day is through If only we knew ... And we all sit around here in our home town Listen to the waves as they all crash down And watch the fire as it slowly burns away Glowing embers lie across the sky Here by my side , in my summer , our last summer The world passes by in my summer , our last summer The light makes shadows fall , surrounded by each other Alive to watch it all , the view from our last summer The view from our last summer ... We trace the sun across the sky And we laugh till we cry Always so hard to say goodbye ( good bye ) And we all sit round here in our home town It 's so good like this , these are times we 'll miss The memories , I hope they 'll never fade Glowing embers lie across the sky Here by my side , in my summer , our last summer The world passes by in my summer , our last summer The light makes shadows fall , surrounded by each other Alive to watch it all , the view through our last summer The view from our last summer ... I would stop time to stay with you I would stop time so we do n't move I would stop time I would stop time I would stop time to keep you Here by my side , in my summer , our last summer The world passes by in my summer , our last summer The light makes shadows fall , surrounded by each other Alive to watch it all , the view from our last summer Love , Keely
