Hey , everyone ! I made this journal so I could put posts up on my sister 's Blog , which is basically a shrine to her baby , ( Christian ) Nick . My day at school was pretty good . Everything is so busy -- -sometimes stressful -- -at this time of year . Signing yearbooks , planning summer excursions , cramming for finals , saying goodbye to friends who are going away for the summer , etcetera . Also , this is your last chance at doing something in middle school ... once we get to high school , the bits run up . If you have one last thing you have to do , someone you need to make amends with , a teacher you want to thank , a boy you want to confess your love to ( not in my particular case , but for a lot of my friends ) -- well then now 's the time . High school will be a whole new ball game ! I 'm excited for ~**Summer 2004**~ Hope to see all of you , have a lot of time to hang out , and mostly ... NOT BE GROUNDED ! ! Gim me a call everyone ! 728-1361 **Keely**
