Wow ... I had Amanda Smerz over today after soccer practice ( which was fun , btw ) and it was crazy ! We were laughing the whole time ! And we picked lilacs for my mom and we kept walking past Joe Serre 's house to get them , and we were all trying to get a glimpse of him , and he dirtbiked past us and said : `` Wow , so you 've walked past here like 8 times ... '' and did n't believe that it was to get lilacs ... ..AHHH he 's really cute and I might just have a crush on him ... .THEN I BROKE A FENCE ! It was hilarious ... .I hope I do n't get caught ! Haha , well , more tomorrow ... . Love , Keely
