I hung out with Leah Rogotzke all weekend . It was great fun : ) ... ..we hung out w/some Woodland girls , volunteered 4 Grandma 's marathon , and went to `` Mean Girls . '' I loved that movie ! It was a great weekend . Then today , I 've been a bit lazy and tired , but I did clean my room . Everything is perfectly neat except under the bed , which I 'm gon na tackle later , and even that 's not so bad ... ... . LOVE , Keely
