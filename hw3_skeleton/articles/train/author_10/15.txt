Today , I slept in , and then cleaned my room partially after taking a shower , and then Kalsie called and she wanted me to go to old-guy Bob 's house with Lisa and her . Mom drove me there , and Megan was there , too , and we all hung out awhile . Christine stopped by , too . Then my sister Leah picked me up and drove me home , and I talked on the phone and on-line . So far my day has been a little boring , hopefully it picks up . Love , Keely
