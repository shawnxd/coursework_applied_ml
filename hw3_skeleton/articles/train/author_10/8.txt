... and the tender warmth inside is released into my life ... '' ~Firefly , Saves the Day Hey ! Last night was really nice ... I talked to Nikita and Phil on the phone for like 3-4 hours , lol . And it made me really happy to talk to Nikita again , and we made plans for Wednesday . I 've missed her so much this summer , even tho I love the rest of my friends ! ! But I 'm really glad I made plans with Kita again ... oh , and also last night , my mom got a turtle and we let it free in the swampy area on our land and soon we 're gon na have lots of turtles ... they 're really ugly , so I 'm not super excited about that ... lol , oh well ! Tonight I have a soccer game @ Jean Duluth..I 'm so glad it 's not in the Cities today . I 'm sooooo not up to riding in a car for like 6 hours tonight ... thank God it 's a home game ... I hope the coach is n't mad b/c I missed 2 practices b/c my mom was out of town and I had to stay @ Leah 's all weekend so I would n't get kidnapped or something ( says my mom ) . Well , I got ta go , but more after my soccer game , or maybe tomorrow ... .hugs and kisses to you all ... LOVE , Keely
