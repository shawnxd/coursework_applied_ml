Hey , my day has been pretty boring ... I have a soccer game in Fridley tonight and I 'm riding down with Lucia Goin , a really nice girl on my soccer team . That should be pretty fun ... I really wan na score a goal ! I 've scored 4 so far this season ... I 'm sorta in a weird mood right now . I 'm both bummed and happy ... .AHH , hormones ! ! The crazy things teenagers go through ! lol ... I 'm done ... More later ! Love , Keely
