Well my parents decided for the remainder of my 2 years of high school I wo n't be doing it at home I will be doing it through the local high school . it all started when my sister though it would be a fantastic idea to go to high school just to make friends , I dough she ever get any were in there ... and they ( like always ) dragged me into it and before I can even get off in my work there picking out what classes I will be doing next year , when they do n't tell use anything about them except the points they get that 's about it ... also my dad feel that waking up around 9-12 in the morning is a bad thing e wants me to wake up every day at 7 before my dad goes to work because he wants me to get a done and have some fun after school and get into the routine of waking up at a normal time but I told him I can still get all my school done before 3 even if I wake up at 1 O_o and even if I had a job that required to wake up at 7 I can get up , but they never listen ... it kinda funny living in silicon forest because just about anything that gets into your computer is made in the state you could probably build a complete computer ( minus the case ) from dealing with a couple of friends at work . not like I do that , my dad did he was talking about video cards and one of his friends said that they know a guy at a ati disturbing ( a company that takes the cards and put them into boxes some times changing the cooling on them ) and he some how made a deal that if he could get him a motherboard from intel ( which we have plently of sitting in are house : ) that he would get him a brand spanking new ati 9800 all-in-wonder pro 256meg this was a week ago ... I wonder when this will all happen ? because my dads video card will go into my I ca n't wait to be upgraded : ) ( radeon 9100 to radeon 9600xt *drool* ) if any one reads , until next err session .
