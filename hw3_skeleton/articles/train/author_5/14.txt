Well my camping trip is over it lasted 2 days we stayed at the beach in a yurt ( nice too ) the first day we were there the beach had winds of 50+ mph : O it was insane the second day we just did normal camping things , camp fire , cooked and ate fatty foods and played around the camp and the beach when we got back my grandma finally ordered that clock thing ( might as well call it a floating-clock ) our neighbor 's are still on there vacation they will be back soon but they send us a email saying there having fun and all : ) I been working on my programming , right now I am working on a web browser that has it own http and html code not like some others that use ie 's or netscapes . it project name right now is Dragon but I call it something else when I get a good name into my brain I also have a huge game in development not going to tell you much the project name and profile the final title will be A.R.R.T.S it will be a 3D RTS I will give no info at this time because I really have n't got a lot to say and it on hold until a newer version of pb is ready to be downloaded : BUT I can assure you that I will not cancel the project I may re-code it and cost me 5 years of my life but I will get it out the door : D as the idea is very unique and nothing has really come close to the interesting idea of this , well except one but I wo n't tell you because I 'll give away too much : P
