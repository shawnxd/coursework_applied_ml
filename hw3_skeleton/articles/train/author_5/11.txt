Well my dad got an an award at work and there 's a convention for that down in California and my mom want to go to a photoshop convetion so they leave tomorrow and my neighbor 's going to watch us : ) so all is arranged and there set to go also my `` holo clock '' is finally being shipped and will arrive this week ( this wensday-thursday ) so I happy about that since a waited a week already ... yesterday my dad was getting bored because he had no games to play as he finished farcry , so he picked up `` breed '' it 's ok needs some improving in art and textures the really bad thing about this game is that the AI COMPLETELY SUCKS.. it just horrible your team mates often get stuck or kill them selves because they used a route that involves walking off a cliff : but I do have to say some of it is pretty good story is n't half bad and the voice acting is pretty good put some HI res textures that look nice and redo the AI and you have a battlefield 1942 clone that takes place in 2060 ^_^ I also found a very odd site , its a guy who was really bored so he hooked up his webcam , lamps , lights , toys ... To the internet so that people can watch as people click the lights on and off and if some one is there have fun watching them watch you mess with there lights if you want to have a good laugh go urlLink here
