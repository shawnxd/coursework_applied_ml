After watching the season finale of star trek : enterprise it bugs me that I have to wait 6 months until the next season episodes . the ending was very good but my god WHY ! The always leave us hanging , and plus we have no clue what the heck what that was at the end and what it means . I was reading around the urlLink star trek site for the The next season and I found out that they a lot of people trying to keep Star Trek running . if you want to know I do like watching star trek but I 'm not a super duper trekkie fan , I 've just always watched the The series since I can remember . the other things that happened to day it my parents got me the PC gamer magazine that has a special on Half-life 2 which was very cool . They also and also had some thing about `` guild wars '' and `` black and white 2 '' not much but it was something . guild wars has a free beta demo which I tried once not really fun yeah it has pvp and coop monster killing but it all 4-8 player based nothing huge to it pretty much lowers the level of battling , from mmorpg war to rpg lan gaming which I s comparable to dungeon siege but at least in dungeon siege the world it limitless ( well almost ) if you want to check out `` urlLink Guild Wars `` or `` urlLink Half-Life 2 `` or even `` urlLink Black and White 2 `` just click the links
