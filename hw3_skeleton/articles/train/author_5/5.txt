Well since I started the last post late at night I kinda dropped off . so hear is some more info I have 3 sisters and I am the only boy , so that 's an odd mix as you can tell I was the first born and we all live in a nice house my mom love to play around the garden planting flowers , fruits , Veggies ect . my dad works most of the day and we only see him at the end , lunch break when , and weekends this could be a normal family if you subtract the 2 cats , lizards , and 2 of my sisters . but we ca n't let that happen : ) so something else to say in hear except what I am like ( yeah , I not that pathetic ) . yesterday my grandparents flew in from New York to spend 2 weeks , like the do every year and as so we had to prepare for there coming which I hate because we spend all day cleaning , baking cookies , moving the beds around so that my 2 other sisters can all sleep in a bed and still have a bed for them . other than that nothing else has happened because I lazy and just woke up an hour ago : \
