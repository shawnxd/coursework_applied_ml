Jello this is the first post of my blog ( as you can tell ) if anybody other than people I know in person see this congratulation , because seriously need to get something to do : P the reason for me to creating this blog is because pass the time through bored times . which is a lot and with the summer comings up there will some EXTREME bored times ahead : now about me and what I do on a normal bases , I 'm am smart , slightly geeky : O , funny guy . I like computers , games , programming ( which included game development ) , cats ( Bomber , databug , pearl , Sam ) , and my lizards : ) most of the day I wake up 10:00 am yes I have school but its at home so I can do such things , MAHAHAH I do my school and house work after that I usually go right on to the computer to do `` work '' on my programs\games I 'm developing or if I 'm frustrated with a bug I go play dod or ns ( half-life mods ) steam . well that 's it for now I will post something tomorrow : D
