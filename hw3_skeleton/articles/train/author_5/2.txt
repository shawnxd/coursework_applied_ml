Today my grandma got like 5 pounds of strawberry ( no kidding ) we all cleaned and sliced them then put them into a massive bowl and added an massive amount of sugar to make the juices of the star berry come out : ) and after dinner we had huge strawberry shortcakes , very good , I when back for seconds : D also since my grandma only comes out every 2 years , she offered me a gift of my choice ( at the expense of my birthday and some Christmas money : S ) so I mention I been keeping my eye on this : and agreed to order it for me : ) I always wanted one of these but never got one : ) but this model particularity has some interesting features like ; `` User Programmable Messages - 4 custom messages up to 200 characters can be stored in memory and programmed to display on certain dates or as often as you like ! '' and `` Quartz Accuracy - Precision microcomputer-controlled instrument has a high accuracy crystal controlled clock and built-in 100 year calendar '' even if it has 100 years of max lifetime I do n't think it or me will last that long : o it claims to have `` Captivating animations/digital effects - Interesting non-stop graphic action on the display attracts and fascinates viewers '' but I only seen old ones that have only 2 different ones I pretty sure there be more as this seams like a new one and I never seen this one before well even if it has n't very many animations/digital effects it very cool : ) and besides I pretty sure I could figure out something to `` enhance '' the features on it
