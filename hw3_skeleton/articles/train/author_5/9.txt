Well my parents are on the ground and are en route to the house , which I happy about : ) I got my holo-clock and having a ball with it : D I set up the clock to say ( randomly ) `` Dreglor ROCKS ! `` , '' Beware the mushroom people are coming ! : O '' , '' Chocolate num nums ? '' and on my birthday say `` WOOHOO ! It 's my birthday '' I can just watch it all day ... I did notice when I first was getting out of the package that it was controlled by a micro-controller ( basic stamp maybe ) because the main chip was replaceable all I know it that it 's replaceable and the chip is 28 pin . I 've already begun to figure out how it does what it does > ) my parents had there share of exictment in SF after taking pictures of `` master commander '' ship and feeling an earthquake from the 28 floor they said that they had enough execitment for the week during the days they were gone I was happy playing Might and magic 6 because I always loved that game and never really finished it ( like most games ) so after 3 days of constant play I happy to say I am in the middle of the game ( I think ... ) I mean this game is insanely long and has so much detail it plain fun to find the best way of doing things and the way you level up is just enough to have you satified but still wanting more points for the skills
