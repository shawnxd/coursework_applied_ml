Well the reason i have n't put anything up is because the new version of firefox ( 0.9 ) corrupted a lot of things so i could n't get my bookmark ( but i still have them thank god ) i counld n't login , hit the back button , see flash , shockwave , and a lot of things the only thing is i could do was browse when the patch was released i deleted the corrupted files ( but not the bookmark ) and it all working now so what happened you ask ? well today my summer vacation is now officially here not much about hl2 except *it will* be release in summer valve mentioned august ( which is still in summer ) and a German video posted at urlLink http : //www.halfliferadio.com/ it shows stuff about cs : s so if any one can translate what they were saying please tell me i started work on an installer creator and installer called `` Rolgerd installer '' it Dreglor backwards yes i have no sense in names but its interesting it almost complete the beta should be on the purebasic forums soon ( matter of a few weeks or days , depends on how much i get done each day if there is any ) also some one on irc explained ( more like flooded ) and excellent idea for keeping my software crack-resistant maybe crack proof and I 'm not lieing but i will not explain it here and you know why there always watching ... my mom who works at the church as a youth teacher has an summer idea for a party involving my lava lamp , a disco ball , and records far as i can tell were doing a late-70 style party for this wensday there also be a water fight/party in the backyard with water balloons and squirt guns , but that does n't happen until mid July and i found just yesterday very interesting and fun little physic demo for a gpdk ( game physic development kit ) features very good life like physics try both the jeep demo and the showcase one the jeep is 11meg and the showcase is only 1.8 Meg . urlLink Jeep Demo urlLink Showcase showcase there both very cool the jeep has some good textures and has shadowing give the physics a nice look on my computer my video card crashes ( yes it can and it does it just resets the video card a slight pause and flickering of the screen ) in some demos but its all cool i noticed a bug in the showcase if you pull ( left click ) an object then while holding the object pull it ( right click ) then let go of both mouse buttons the object will continue to hang there as if you were still holding it there now you ca n't release the object but were ever you click to pull the object will zip to the location with great force and you can hold more than one object the same way . so you can have a monstiosity of objects all trying to get to the same location and in the static mesh demo and castle demo you can click and hold the object and use it as plow-ball hehe use the well ( ? ) stone to obliterate the wall : ) can pick up all the objects ( with time ) and the move your mouse in circles to make all the objects orbit around and watch them slowly come together like some weird planet enjoy ~Dreglor
