my life is a good colour . i feel like though not everything in my life is wonderful ( poor me ... ) things are going in a direction i can agree with and enjoy . my family strife and other issues ( actually there is just family strife ... ) seem petty now instead of aggrivating and arent as difficult to deal with . I am surrounded with people who i respect and who respect me and i feel like i am just barely dipping into a world of people that will really help me grow into a person ... the person , whatevr , that i want to be . So thank you for being who you are , even you people who just come across this and post a comment , you dont understand how much i appreciate you . mahal kita to the one who is closest , thank you for taking me for who i am and being consistant in your support and warmth , without you i dont know where i would be , and im glad i can be where i am with a person like you to live life with .
