this heat is oppresive , i thought germany was hot , this is unbearable , my usual disposition to clothes has escalated into something that will soon grow to be possibly public offensive if this damndable heat continues . im not gon na get my job back , there are reasons ; budget crap and new policy B.S . but the fact remains that i am now without a source of income . 400 dollars in the bank and 500 untouchable dollars in savings is all i have to my name ... and 400 dollars is good , but i dont like my money dwindling without it growing again , and i have a feeling it will dwindle quite quickly without a job . so ... looking for a job with a subtle cloud of dissapointment looming over my shoulder , i hope this gloomy shroud doesnt creep into other potential possibilities in my life . whereas my job situation at the moment is rather dismal , other aspects of my life seem to be going rather well ... and i would be quite pleased if they were to stay that way . i always seem to have hope , and this is good .
