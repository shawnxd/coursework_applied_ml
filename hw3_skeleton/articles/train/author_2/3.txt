bleh ive been so tired lately , i dont know why , my mild insomnia took a crap on my face after i got back from germany , my clock ( internal ) is messed up in a way i dont like , im supposed to be up into the late hours of the night pondering my existance , and right now all i can ponder is where the hell i left my shoes and how nice a pillow and or bed sounds . sigh , i think i just need to wait it out and ... ugh , go to bed . i wish that people didnt need to talk , that emotion and expression could just be shared on a deeper level than the brain . none of us would have to deal with deception or mixed vibes or ... idk of course there would still be mixed vibes , there isnt a way around it , i just really really wish there was , things are so simple for me in terms of whats going on in me ... well at least most of the time , but if people could just feel whats going on in my heart , there wouldnt be need for second gussing or ... i really dont know im not speaking about anyone in particular , any one who knows my situation wont believe that but im really not , im just feeling frustrated we cant REALLY say what we mean to eachother , there is always room for the words to come out wrong or a chance of saying the wrong thing ... if people could just show each other what was really going on in their soul , what was down in their heart , i really honestly believe there would be a lot less confusion in relationships , if people could give more than thier word in a promise , a real testiment of what it is they are truly feeling ... it would be so perfect . at least for me i suppose . ive been so tired lately , the nights have been so bleak .
