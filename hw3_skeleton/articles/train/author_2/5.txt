yes despite the odds i had a really good time last night , it was so much fun ! i was at first going out of duty to my friends , i was expecting there would be the suprise and then we would just ... sit , and do nothing all night . but i was willing to do that , my friends are important , those 2 are all thats left from middle school , and im not one to be opposed to new people , ont he contrary , i love new people , but its good to have people to know what you 've gone through for the years , no need to introduce , no ice breaking , the good ol ' familiar . so moving on , for the first half hour or so , we ... sat and did nothing ( big suprise to me you can be sure ) but then we went in and dans mom proposed we go see a good friend of hers , his name is forest , he is an old ( well , 40 's old ) eccentric gay man who is QUITE funny , they all drank and carried on , stories of his youth , god he was funny , and then i drove back ( dans mom was a lil tipsy ... i love mary-anne ) and forest came back too , it was maybe 2:00 am when we got back and we put on some music , oldies and new stuff , van morrison and tool , radiohead and the beachboys , it was so fun , my oldest of friends jake got drunk for his first time , and had his first cigg , and he has discovered that not all that is illegal is a bad thing ! ! ah he knew this before but he is one to cling to something for the sole reason of clinging , which is fine , i cling aplenty , i suppose its just the things we cling to are ... subtly different . forest left at approx 3:30 am and after he left i was able to resolve the majority of my conflicted feeling the the day prior to night festivities . resloved-ness , i love it . so things are back to their norm , or as norm as it can be for a while , but i must say im happy , and im gon na try to hold onto this when my next ... . bout , comes 'round . im sure it 'll be all good .
