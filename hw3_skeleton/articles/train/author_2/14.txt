a wonderful night to put it mildly , but this is a night to put things mildly , to leave things behind corners you cant wrap your tongue around , a night to leave ones brain spinning in circles , a blind dog chasing its tail on the freeway . i hit every light green coming home , it flowed with my mind , green-fresh thoughts , consistant . They seemed vibrant in the black sky , the lights and my meandering brain , flowing from one to the next with an ease that has n't dripped on my parched tongue in a long time . so a dying man has found his water , and now what do i do ? just keep driving i guess , oh but the anticipation ! the utter delight that no other cars are congesting my road , my smooth concrete . parallel to that , those persistant thoughts , equally smooth and just as heavy . heavy like a gallon of ice cream , vanilla pleasure , bitter vineger turned to chocolate in the blink of an eye ... how did i miss it ? ice cream like concrete ; but wet now , it fills in the cracks and spaces , the ones you dont step on when you are small , wouldnt want to break your mothers back . the spaces in memory stretch and , grow dim ? not dim , the opposite ! this is a vivid trip down memory lane , but the clock is still ticking clockwise , im going forwards not backwards , my blind furry friend isnt running counter clockwise in his free way fiesta , no . forward , towards a house with the porch light on , it shines . brown glass , deep , dark , vibrant , glowing , shining , it shines , i told you , and i spoke true , it shines . shine .
