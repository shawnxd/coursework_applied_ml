how could 2 grand events clash with such a mighty force as they are tonight ? My good friends 17th b-day suprise party and an awesome concert with a person i absolutely love to be around ... all on a friday night . i went with the b-day party . sigh . it was so hard and i can never express what is going on in my head when i have to choose like this , because nobody really expects me to do anything with them , but they cant help hurting when i dont . and this is the last thing i want . words that have been spoken are true , no one is forcing me to sit down with them and chill , who i choose to be with is my choice and mine alone , and its so easy for me to create little worlds where i just exist in a happy delerium with a person i would never want to leave my side . I wonder , no im confident that i would feel just as shity if i chose to go to the concert , so ... . ugh i dont know . i hope you have fun jennifer .
