yesterday was wonderful , went to the beach with jenn kat and john ( i think his name was john ... ) all dresed up in nice clothes , jenn and kat in their prom clothes and john and i just ... dressed up ... yeah so it was cool , the weather was rather bizarre , it was really foggy but at the same time sunny . ( as in the fog was ground level and up maybe 30 ft up and then it was blue sky with the sun beating down on us . ) it was hot and we splashed around in the water a lil bit , then john left ( wow i really hope thats his name ... ) and it got sunny ( haha it was all his fault it was foggy ) and ya . really chill . then i got home and BOOM . UBER DEPRESSION MODE , like seriously , it was crazy , and nothing had really gone wrong during the day , and i had not been greeted at the front door with bitching . strange to say the least . yeah and then another suprise : desperate to leave the house , i ask my mom at midnight if i can go to jakes house ... . ( an impossibility ) and to my utter and complete suprise it was ok. this never happens then i got to jakes and it was all laughes , my bad mood completely gone . i dont understand but oh well , things are good , im happy . ****i apologise if that was just ... what i did that day . i dont like doing that ... oh and no my title isnt related to my blog in anyway what so ever , it 's not even an inside joke ... i just ... couldnt think of a `` profound '' or witty title****
