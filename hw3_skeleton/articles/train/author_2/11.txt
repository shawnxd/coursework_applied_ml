ciggareten and gay pride , with z and y reversed on the key board . these are my profound new looks at germany . im having fun , but i miss jennifer like mad , and whats the worst is our departure the morning b4 i left , that was reallz ... unfortunate . not because i got in trouble , actuallz i didnt get in that much trouble , mz mom is joking about it and stuff , kinda cool i guess . i just think its horrible how she has to worrz about mz mom hating her now , which isnt true . the truth is , mz mom hates everz girl i meet till i dont like her anzmore , it pisses me off how she keeps throwing shit about jenelle in mz face . `` jenelle didnt do this '' and `` i never saw jenelle leave those on zour neck '' grrr , but its cool , she 'll come around , and if she doesnt , she 'll just have to deal with it , because i reallz dont want anzthing to change between jennifer and i. i dont have her e-mail . in fact , i dont havce anzones e-mail that i want to talk to . i reallz want to talk to wei , and i reallz want to talk to jennifer , and i have neither one of their e-mails ... . sigh . im realz not in the mood to do this right now , but at the same time i reallz am , i think the z and y being switched is reallz disrupting mz ... flow . lol and i keep sighing . well , time is monez , and if bz anz freak chance either wei or jennifer read this , please leave me a comment with those e-mails ... or e-mail me i guess ... sigh .
