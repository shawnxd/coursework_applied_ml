jeez just went to raley 's after 3 weeks of gone-ness and there was a crew working that i didnt get along with at best on the job there and there were bad vibes to put it mildly at my perusing , but perhaps its just my paranoia . i guess i didnt think about how i might actually have to work a lil to get my job BACK once i came home from germany , i really need tot alk to the guy that hired me : sam parcher . he 's a cool guy , he liked me , he 'll hook me up with my job again.. i hope . i have a shot glass for him from germany , maybe that 'll help a lil bit ... sigh . i really hope i get my job back .
