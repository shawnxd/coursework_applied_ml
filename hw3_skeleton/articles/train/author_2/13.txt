the only time i am ever up this early is ... well actually im up this early quite often , i just want a dramatic hook to illustrate that i have been up for many hours with no or little rest . i made a photo album , but the pictures are to big to put in my profile and i dont understand url enough to put them in here , so ja ... http : //photobucket.com/albums/v311/bandnerd9000/ there are cool pictures my cousin took in L.A in there , he took them and i edited them in photoshop , some pretty cool effects i guess . my life is goood , im too tired to put it all poetically like i usually like to do , ar at least try to do , but yeah things are happy with me , at least most of it is , still i ssues with my madre but what 's new with that ? it doesnt bring me down , well , it doesnt bring me down right now ... maybe this is de to the fact that i 'm miles away from her ... so my dad is in town , havent seen him in a long time ... . i wonder how it 'll be ? i feel good .
