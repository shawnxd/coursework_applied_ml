not sure if i mentioned in a previous post , but i hate the heat . i am not a sun bunny . do n't like outdoor activities . no beach , no camping , no hiking . do n't really like to sweat . which kinda sucks since i live in hawaii . i really should be used to it , having been born and raised here , but i really do n't like the sun . i avoid the beach like the plague . i do n't even know how to swim . i always joke that it is some kind of karmic retribution for some evil deed done in a previous life . it could be . i just ca n't see myself leaving here though . i 'm doubly screwed .
