That is the song by Paulina Rubio that I 've been obsessed with for 3 days now . Heard 5 seconds of it on a commercial on Vh1 and searched on Yahoo for the title . Paulina Rubio apparently sings it . Downloaded it from iTunes Music Store and now ca n't stop playing it . But I have to play it on my iPod 'cause roommates are sick of hearing me play it on repeat . AAAAHHHHHH
