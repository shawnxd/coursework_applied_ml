I hope that 's how you spell it . But just had that for lunch . Really good . Had it without the round onions though , ca n't stand the after taste of round onions . Green onions are fine , just not round onions . It was from Jun Bo . Nice little hole in the wall restaurant . Is behind the blood bank in downtown , down an alley way that smells of urine . Of course most alley ways smell like that . Alley ways and stairwells . No matter what kind of building , all the stairwells seem to smell of urine . Very odd , and disgusting . But the shrimp fu yung was good . very good .
