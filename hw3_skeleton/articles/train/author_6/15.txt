Greg Maddux of the Chicago Cubs picked up his 300th win today against the San Francisco Giants in SBC Park . It was n't a typical Maddux outing in that he only pitched five innings , giving up four runs on seven hits with three walks . Yet it seems fitting that the great competitor Maddux would have to struggle his way to the great 300 win milestone . It is even more fitting that he should pick up his # 300 with the same team he picked up # 1 . Maybe the most fitting is that he could be the last 300 game-winner in the history of the game . His former teammate Tom Glavine is the only remaining player with a chance to get there , and the evolution of the game indicates that no future pitcher will ever achieve this great milestone . So `` Mad Dog '' Maddux has achieved a great milestone with a fastball topping out around 85 ; most say he made his career out of astonishing command . He may have this , but what he 's made a career out of is having guts - being a tenacious competitor . Congratulations to you , Greg Maddux ! -M .
