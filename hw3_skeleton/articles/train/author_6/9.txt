Wow , I 'm e-mailing stuff directly onto my blog ... I 'm so easily amused , are n't I ? Anyway , talkin ' to **censored name** now . She got a cell phone today , so she 's pretty happy , even if she 's mad at me , which I think she is . She said I could stop by her house on Wednesday , though , so it 's all cool . **Censored name** was asking what I did to her earlier tonight too ... But then **censored name** denied bein ' mad at me , so I 'm kinda confused . Oh well . I 'm having too much fun blogging via e-mail ! Signing off , M .
