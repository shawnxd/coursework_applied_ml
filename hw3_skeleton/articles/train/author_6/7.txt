Yay ! I got my license today ! Oh , and I picked up an application from Pizza Hut , which I 'm going to have to drop off sometime tomorrow . I 'm so happy about getting my license for some reason . But I 'm sad too , because dear 'ol **censored name** got nervous and did n't get her license today ... I came into the DMV today just as she was getting out , and I felt so bad for her . I really hope she gets online so I can play healer again ... So ironic that I 'm the one that gets thrust into that role , is it not ? Yet , it seems that people with problems are drawn to me . Anyway , enough of my life calling garbage ... Signing off , M .
