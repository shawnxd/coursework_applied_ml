Today I experimented with the LiveIM thingy on my phone ... It seems pretty cool . I think I wan na get a text messaging plan , which I 've already been told I have to pay for . Not like this is a problem , since I 'm applying at Pizza Hut once I get my license . Speaking of that , it 's TWO DAYS from now ( less than , actually ) ! Oh , and I wished good ol ' **censored name** a happy 16th today . I hope she gets online later tonight ... I have n't like really talked to her since the Six Flags trip , which has been a while . No one 's online right now , though ... So sad ... Signing off , M .
