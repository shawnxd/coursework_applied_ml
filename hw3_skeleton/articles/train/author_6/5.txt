I went driving all by my lonesome to **censored name** 's today ... Are n't I proud ? We went to Pizza Hut and dropped off my application and also picked up a blank tape at Pamida for my mom . Then we went back to his house and played lots of Age of Mythology before I had to go back home ... That 's pretty much it . Signing off , M .
