TWO DAYS UNTIL MY LICENSE ! ! ! YES ! ! ! Oh , and it 's **censored name** 's birthday today . I already sent her an e-mail wishing her a happy 16th . I think she 's still a little mad at me , which is upsetting . **Censored name** 's a great friend , I really hope she appreciates the e-mail within the first hour of her b-day . I wan na go visit her when I get my license , so we have to be on good terms again . Anyway , that 's all for now ... Signing off , M .
