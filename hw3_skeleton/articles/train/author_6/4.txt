Wow , yesterday was so boring I did n't even blog anything . Today I just sat at home watching the Olympics until like 4:15 when I drove myself into church . When I got home Dad and I went to eat at Monical 's because the girls are out of town ... The problem was that I then got forced to drive Dad to the goddamn concession stand at the football game where I was stuck for way too long ... Not like I had anything to do at home anyway , but still , I would rather have been home . Anyway ... Signing off , M .
