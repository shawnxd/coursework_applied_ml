well , for my self to do something and keep my thoughts away from other things I 've decided to jump back into the computer things again ... I 'm gon na study how binary works , how to do boolean equatations , as well as logic equatations ... yeah , like that means anything to you ; ) anyway , I 've decided that the first time I 'll see danique again ( on msn or face to face ) I 'm gon na say what I feel for her ... I 'm sure to get a big fat NO , also cause I heard she fancy 's a guy from her neighborhood , but anyway , it would make me feel a whole damn lot better to hear it from her mouth ( or her fingers ; ) ) anyway , this is a short blog , since I 'm not in the mood of writing down everything thats bugging , just wanted to show I 'm still alive ( pitty , huh ? ) bye again , I 'm gon na sleep
