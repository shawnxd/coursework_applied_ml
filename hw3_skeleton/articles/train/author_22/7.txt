yes , my 4rth post tonight ... I mean , I 'm busy now anyway , right ? I really really hate the fucking block option in msn , I believ I 'm just being blocked by the only 3 people in my contact list : vince , danique and esther . Well , I dont blame them offcourse , but still , its so not cool : ( at first I decided to keep this blog a secret , but now it feels like everyone has left me , I 'm like : `` Fuck ya'all ! '' and just putted my blog adress in my msn name ... I 'm quite sure they 'll get curious , and going to read the blog , and then their gon na be upset , and pissed , and very very mad , but I dont care ... I want to make a clean ship.. its not like I 'm gon na see them ever again anyway ... I 'm off too another class then them ... They all get high grades , perform good at school , and got like all those things , while I need to study for hours , just to get another F ... wheeh ! Well , I can say for one thing , it feels great to write all the shit down that happened in my life ... Everyone will hate me for it , but fuck everyone ... the only ones I got left that dont move away from me are my fucking fishes ... but then again , they cant wlak or anything ... well , I 'm gon na nap , its 23:15 now , and I 'm sleepy.. Peace out .
