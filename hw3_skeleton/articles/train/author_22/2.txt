I just confronted him with the truth , and highly ashamed , and reallly really lame , he admitted he sended a mail ... but he thought she would never see it anyway , cus its on her old email adress ... Now , I actually dont want to , but still , I feel sorry for the guy ... After all , being in love with someone is the nicest compliment ya can give that person ... or so I think ; ) OMG , the guy was actually mad I knew about the email , but I have n't reavealed anything . Luckely I changed my msn name , just before he could see it , so he didnt read this page yet ... about reading this page.. OMG , the first few comments on my sick sick posts are there ... thats like ... .. really weird : ) but its still nice anyway ( in case ya didnt know ... I do have a nice side ya know ... its just so hard to regonise it under the layers of pain and misserey , and self pity and such ) I find it strange that Danique hasnt replied to vince 's email just yet , or maybe vince doesnt want to say sumting about that too ... Danique didnt revealed anything either when I was chatting with her 10 minutes ago . I dunno , maybe she just doesnt want to hurt vince ? or maybe she really likes him =| OMG , if so be the case , please shoot me ... ... what ? why I havent exactley declared her my love and such ? well , I 'm too much of a shyguy for that , plus I have to draw a number for that ... there 's a long waiting list ... her list of boys who like her is bigger then the list of people who need organ transplants ... also , I can allready predict the answer with my magical 8th sense ( XP ) ... `` NO ! NO WAY ! GET AWAY FROM ME , YA PERV ! ARGH ! How disgusting ! '' yeah , well , I 'm getting weird and emotional again , so I better leave , maybe I 'll post something again 2night ; )
