lol , yeah , in an hour I 'm going to vince.. He doesnt know Danique doesnt like him , yet ... Well , I cant tell him , that would be way too lame , let Danique do that part herself , but I 'm afraid I cant keep my big mouth shut ... I really hate vince @ tha moment ... not for falling in love with Danique or anything , but the fact that he is way too lame to even just notify me about it ... u know , that just sucks , he 's my best friend , and he doesnt even seem to trust me ? weird ... I dunno how I will react when I see him , but I think ( cause I 'm just a shy person , I dont like conflicts ) that I 'm just gon na put on a happy face ... But god , please , please , let him shut up.. cus I 'm not going to be responsible for what happens elseway ... He also persuaded me to come to a school party ( the last school party ) but I dont think I 'm going anymore ... damn ticket cost me â‚¬4 , - but I dont really care about da frigging money ... I just dont like getting stabbed in da back ... got ta go get my medicine now ... I got eyedrops , nosespray , and inhaler ( all of the sudden I 'm having hay fever , and I hate it ) and now I also got stuff for my muscles ... ( bwahahaha , if ya can call it muscles ) damn , I wrecked a few of them . I also bruced a couple of bones while banging my head against the wall yesterday , but I 'll live ( sorry people , hate to dissapoint ya'all , but I will live ... ) well , my plan was to keep this little frigging post a little small , but as ya can see I 'm just to hopeless to do that ; ) got ta go now , wish me luck
