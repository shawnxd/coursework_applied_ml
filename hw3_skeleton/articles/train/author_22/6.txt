Damn , I ca n't seem to shut my subconciousness up ... I try to tell myself I dont give a fuck about anything , or anyone , but it seems like I do ... I 'm depressed now ... Sitting in my chair , just staring at a computerscreen . I do n't feel like moving , but very soon I 'll just have too : ( Well , maybe I 'll just stay home on monday till wednesday.. I mean , its not like anyone at school even cares about me coming or not , so why bother going right ? On wednesday our entire class will go do sumting together ... great is n't it ? I thought we would go swimming or sumting , but instead we goto some weird place ... My dad 's calling me now , I got ta eat . Time to put on my happy mask , and to forget about all my problems for a little while ... bah , well , I just felt like typing again . Have a nice day ...
