A business that makes nothing but money is a poor business . urlLink Henry Ford I dunno , is this business exploding or dying a slow , painful death ? Just surfed in this site urlLink http : //formerdiamond.typepad.com/formerdiamond/ and it said : In the mid 90 ’ s the company said the “ business ” had about 7 billion dollars in retail sales . If I am not mistaken that figure , which today includes all of the Alticor business , is in the $ 4.5 billion range . Well , maybe ! One can make some people fool all the times , and all people fool some of the times , but nobody can make all people fool all the times ! ''
