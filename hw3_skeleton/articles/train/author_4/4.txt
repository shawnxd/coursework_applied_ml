As long as the world shall last there will be wrongs , and if no man objected and no man rebelled , those wrongs would last forever . urlLink Clarence Darrow They said : You build this business with accountability . Stay accountable to your group . If you promise your upline that you ’ re going 1000 PV , do it . If you promise your downline to STP for them , do it . Translation : Ok I ’ m back from puking . First these weasels tell you the power of spoken word and make you commit to a promise . They say it won ’ t happen until you say it . Now when you say it , you have to do it . And doing it means beg , rob or steal , do the required PV . Didn ’ t we deserve any accountability , assholes ? We were told that you ’ ll go platinum via 6-4-2 in 4-6 months . We were told your friends or family definitely gon na join this ; it would be either you or some other IBO who approached them first so we better hurry . We were told it ’ s a very simple business and any body can do it in spare time . We were told it ’ s a joke to do 300 PV . Yeah right ! $ 800 is a joke . How can you see yourself in mirror ? What are you feeding your kids ? Blood sucked out of people who were methodologically deceived into trusting you ?
