We visited urlLink Algonquin Provincial Park last month . It was wonderful ! Algonquin has breath taking beauty of Canada , and one can see nature at its purest there . Every time we visit there , we always see a urlLink Moose . So many activities , so few people . We just love it . We did make a mistake though . After covering some short trails easily , we took on an 11 km trail . Mainly because this trail had wildlife sighting . First problem we faced was mud ! Ground was muddy because of the rain last night and our speed was very slow ! My sister was with us , who is not very skilled in such activities . Another problem was mosquitoes . As soon as we started sweating , mosquitoes attacked us . As my 12 year old brother , Bumpi said , `` We are all-you-can-eat buffet for mosquitoes '' . Bumpi
