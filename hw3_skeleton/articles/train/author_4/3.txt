A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable , but more useful than a life spent doing nothing . urlLink George Bernard Shaw Quixtar critics are usually called losers who just ca n't make it and now they are trying to stop every body else . Let me tell you my another `` failure `` . We started a vending machine business in year 2000 . We bought a franchise for $ 30 , 000 CAD including 17 vending machines and got them installed in different malls . Our parent franchise went bankrupt , left us with no marketing etc . This business generated $ 100 / month on average for 2 years , and then we took the machines off . We lost $ 30,000 . We joined Quixtar ; quit it in less than a year , lost around $ 10k in it . But I am not angry about 30 , 000 we lost in vending machines business . Not at all . Sure , loss is 3 times than Quixtar . And I am fiercely angry at Quixtar . I ’ ll try to explain the reasons . 1 ) There ’ s still hope we can sell that business . Because we OWN it . That was a franchise , so is Quixtar , as they say it is . Can we sell our Quixtar business ? 2 ) We were never told in the vending machine business that we can make millions . Just some extra hundreds . In Quixtar promises were simply outrageous that now I am wondering how people get fooled into it ? Well ! Humans tend to trust each other . 3 ) Our first and only expense on the vending machine business was CAD $ 30,000 . We had to buy material , but its price was very nominal . And we knew about it ! In Quixtar , a person signs up thinking $ 350 ( CAD ) is the only cost but monthly expenses reaches around $ 1000 . And this is excluding redirection from Food basic / Wal-mart . $ 60 STO $ 24 opens $ 100 / month ( 6 trips to US , one trip cost AT LEAST $ 200 ) 300 PV = > $ 650 extra ( 300 PV is actually $ 750 but I subtracted $ 100 I saved by avoiding Wal-Mart ) Shipment , GST + PST on product = $ 50 $ 100 extra fuel $ 21 Kate $ 10 website -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- = $ 1015 / month ( extra ) Are prospects told this is the running cost of quixtar business , assholes ? 4 ) When the vending machines business was dying , our expenses reduced . Less material sold means less material need to be bought . Same goes with time required . In Quixtar , both remains the same , rather increase since SOBs ( Sons of bitches ) push more tapes on you . 5 ) We didn ’ t have to cash-in our relationships to make profit in vending machine business . In Quixtar , family and friends are the first one for STP . 6 ) We didn ’ t think about vending machines all the time . We , however missed no opportunity to talk to the strangers for Quixtar , and were busy listening / talking to upline / downline for rest of the time . 7 ) We never felt guilty in vending machine business for not making enough sales , and no one tried to make us . No body neither insulted us , nor begged us . We were not supposed to do these things as well . 8 ) There was no fucking quota to meet . 9 ) We didn ’ t have to go to any association in our or other country to 'learn the business ' . And don ’ t get me started on those damn associations . I ’ ve written about them in my previous posts . 10 ) For vending machine franchise , I don ’ t have to worry that there are other people out there loosing money in this scam . It was just a business which , for some genuine reasons did not work . Maybe if I sell it to some body that has enough resources , this might work . I 'll try to summarize it . I don ’ t feel bad if I didn ’ t succeed in a legal business . I do feel guilty , angry and embarrassed when I ’ m been scammed , and I am used to scam other people . Let me know if I should think differently . Should I be angry at my failure at vending machine business as well ? Should I feel ok with Quixtar ? And why ? It seems to me that loss of time and money is not that big a deal . $ 30K / 10 hours a week for 2 years vs $ 10K / 25 hours a week for less then a year . Both are losses , yet I 'm quite ok with one and so not with the other .
